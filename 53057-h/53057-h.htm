<p class="reduct p4">“<i>How much more agreeable it is to sit in the midst of old furniture like
Minott’s clock, and secretary and looking-glass, which have come down from
other generations, than amid that which was just brought from the cabinet-maker’s,
smelling of varnish, like a coffin! To sit under the face of an old
clock that has been ticking one hundred and fifty years&mdash;there is something
mortal, not to say immortal, about it; a clock that begun to tick when Massachusetts
was a province.</i>”</p>

<h2 class="p4">Furniture of the Olden Time</h2>

<p class="pch">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE furniture of the American colonies was
at first of English manufacture, but before
long cabinet-makers and joiners plied their
trade in New England, and much of the
furniture now found there was made by the colonists.
In New Amsterdam, naturally, a different style prevailed,
and the furniture was Dutch. As time went
on and the first hardships were surmounted, money
became more plentiful, until by the last half of the
seventeenth century much fine furniture was imported
from England and Holland, and from that
time fashions in America were but a few months
behind those in England.</p>

<p>In the earliest colonial times the houses were but
sparsely furnished, although Dr. Holmes writes of
leaving&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">“The Dutchman’s shore,</p>
<p class="pp6">With those that in the <i>Mayflower</i> came, a hundred souls or more,<br />
Along with all the furniture to fill their new abodes,<br />
To judge by what is still on hand, at least a hundred loads.”</p>

<p class="p1">If one were to accept as authentic all the legends
told of various pieces,&mdash;chairs, tables, desks, spinets,
and even pianos,&mdash;Dr. Holmes’s estimate would be
too moderate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The first seats in general use were forms or
benches, not more than one or two chairs belonging
to each household. The first tables were long
boards placed upon trestles. Chests were found
in almost every house, and bedsteads, of course,
were a necessity. After the first chairs, heavy and
plain or turned, with strong braces or stretchers
between the legs, came the leather-covered chairs
of Dutch origin, sometimes called Cromwell chairs,
followed by the Flemish cane chairs and couches.
This takes us to the end of the seventeenth century.
During that period tables with turned legs fastened
to the top had replaced the earliest “table borde”
upon trestles, and the well-known “hundred legged”
or “forty legged” table had come into use.</p>

<p>Cupboards during the seventeenth century were
made of oak ornamented in designs similar to those
upon oak chests. Sideboards with drawers were not
used in this country until much later, although
there is one of an early period in the South Kensington
Museum, made of oak, with turned legs,
and with drawers beneath the top.</p>

<p>Desks were in use from the middle of the seventeenth
century, made first of oak and later of cherry
and walnut. Looking-glasses were owned by the
wealthy, and clocks appear in inventories of the
latter part of the century. Virginals were mentioned
during the seventeenth century, and spinets were
not uncommon in the century following.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the eighteenth century
came the strong influence of Dutch fashions, and
chairs and tables were made with the Dutch cabriole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
or bandy leg, sometimes with the shell upon the
knee, and later with the claw-and-ball foot. Dutch
high chests with turned legs had been in use before
this, and the high chest with bandy legs like the
chairs and tables soon became a common piece of
furniture. With other Dutch fashions came that of
lacquering furniture with Chinese designs, and tables,
scrutoirs or desks, looking-glass frames, stands, and
high chests were ornamented in this manner.</p>

<p>The wood chiefly used in furniture was oak, until
about 1675, when American black walnut came into
use, and chests of drawers, tables, and chairs were
made of it; it was the wood oftenest employed in
veneer at that time.</p>

<p>Sheraton wrote in 1803: “There are three species
of walnut tree, the English walnut, and the white
and black Virginia. Hickory is reckoned to class
with the white Virginia walnut. The black Virginia
was much in use for cabinet work about forty
or fifty years since in England, but is now quite laid
by since the introduction of mahogany.”</p>

<p>Mahogany was discovered by Sir Walter Raleigh
in 1595. The first mention of its use in this
country is in 1708. Mr. G. T. Robinson, in the
London <i>Art Journal</i> of 1881, says that its first use
in England was in 1720, when some planks of it
were brought to Dr. Gibbon by a West India
captain. The wood was pronounced too hard, and
it was not until Mrs. Gibbon wanted a candle-box
that any use was made of the planks, and then only
because the obstinate doctor insisted upon it. When
the candle-box was finished, a bureau (<i>i.e.</i> desk) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
made of the wood, which was greatly admired, and
as Mr. Robinson says, “Dr. Gibbon’s obstinacy and
Mrs. Gibbon’s candle-box revolutionized English
household furniture; for the system of construction
and character of design were both altered by its introduction.”
It is probable that furniture had been
made in England of mahogany previous to 1720,
but that may be the date when it became fashionable.</p>

<p>The best mahogany came from Santiago, Mexican
mahogany being soft, and Honduras mahogany
coarse-grained.</p>

<p>The earliest English illustrated book which included
designs for furniture was published by
William Jones in 1739. Chippendale’s first book
of designs was issued in 1754. He was followed
by Ince and Mayhew, whose book was undated;
Thomas Johnson&mdash;1758; Sir William Chambers&mdash;1760;
Society of Upholsterers&mdash;about 1760;
Matthias Lock&mdash;1765; Robert Manwaring&mdash;1766;
Matthias Darly&mdash;1773; Robert and
J. Adam&mdash;1773; Thomas Shearer (in “The
Cabinet-makers’ London Book of Prices”)&mdash;1788;
A. Hepplewhite &amp; Co.&mdash;1789; Thomas Sheraton&mdash;1791-1793
and 1803.</p>

<p>Sir William Chambers in his early youth made a
voyage to China, and it is to his influence that we
can attribute much of the rage for Chinese furniture
and decoration which was in force about 1760 to 1770.</p>

<p>Thomas Chippendale lived and had his shop in
St. Martin’s Lane, London. Beyond that we know
but little of his life. His book, “The Gentleman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and Cabinet-Maker’s Director,” was published in
1754, at a cost of £3.13.6 per copy. The second
edition followed in 1759, and the third in 1762. It
contains one hundred and sixty copper plates, the
first twenty pages of which are taken up with designs
for chairs, and it is largely as a chair-maker that
Chippendale’s name has become famous. His furniture
combines French, Gothic, Dutch, and Chinese
styles, but so great was his genius that the effect is
thoroughly harmonious, while he exercised the greatest
care in the construction of his furniture&mdash;especially
chairs. He was beyond everything a carver,
and his designs show a wealth of delicate carving.
He used no inlay or painting, as others had done
before him, and as others did after him, and only
occasionally did he employ gilding, lacquer, or brass
ornamentation.</p>

<p>Robert and James Adam were architects, trained
in the classics. Their furniture was distinctly classical,
and was designed for rooms in the Greek or
Roman style. Noted painters assisted them in
decorating the rooms and the furniture, and Pergolesi,
Angelica Kaufmann, and Cipriani did not
scorn to paint designs upon satinwood furniture.</p>

<p>Matthias Lock and Thomas Johnson were notable
as designers of frames for pier glasses, ovals,
girandoles, etc.</p>

<p>Thomas Shearer’s name was signed to the best
designs of those published in 1788 in “The Cabinet-Makers’
Book of Prices.” His drawings comprise
tables of various sorts, dressing-chests, writing-desks,
and sideboards, but there is not one chair among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
them. He was the first to design the form of sideboard
with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>As Chippendale’s name is used to designate the
furniture of 1750-1780, so the furniture of the succeeding
period may be called Hepplewhite; for although
he was one of several cabinet-makers who
worked together, his is the best-known name, and
his was probably the most original genius. His
chairs bear no resemblance to those of Chippendale,
and are lighter and more graceful; but because of
the attention he paid to those qualifications, strength
of construction and durability were neglected. His
chair-backs have no support beside the posts which
extend up from the back legs, and upon these the
shield or heart-shaped back rests in such a manner
that it could endure but little strain.</p>

<p>Hepplewhite’s sideboards were admirable in form
and decoration, and it is from them and his chairs
that his name is familiar in this country. His swell
or serpentine front bureaus were copied in great
numbers here.</p>

<p>His specialty was the inlaying or painting with
which his furniture was enriched. Satinwood had
been introduced from India shortly before this, and
tables, chairs, sideboards, and bureaus were inlaid
with this wood upon mahogany, while small pieces
were veneered entirely with it. The same artists
who assisted the Adam brothers painted medallions,
wreaths of flowers or arabesque work upon Hepplewhite’s
satinwood furniture. Not much of this
painted furniture came to this country, but the
fashion was followed by our ancestresses, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
taught, among other accomplishments, to paint
flowers and figures upon light wood furniture,
tables and screens being the pieces usually chosen
for decoration.</p>

<p>Thomas Sheraton published in 1791 and 1793,
“The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer’s Drawing
Book”; in 1803, his “Cabinet Dictionary”; in
1804, “Designs for Household Furniture,” and
“The Cabinet-Maker, Upholsterer, and General
Artist’s Encyclopedia,” which was left unfinished
in 1807.</p>

<p>“The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer’s Drawing
Book” is largely taken up with drawings and
remarks upon perspective, which are hopelessly unintelligible.
His instructions for making the pieces
designed are most minute, and it is probably due to
this circumstantial care that Sheraton’s furniture,
light as it looks, has lasted in good condition for a
hundred years or more.</p>

<p>Sheraton’s chairs differ from Hepplewhite’s, which
they resemble in many respects, in the construction
of the backs, which are usually square, with the back
legs extending to the top rail, and the lower rail
joining the posts a few inches above the seat. The
backs were ornamented with carving, inlaying, painting,
gilding, and brass. The lyre was a favorite
design, and it appears in his chair-backs and in the
supports for tables, often with the strings made of
brass wire.</p>

<p>Sheraton’s sideboards are similar to those of
Shearer and Hepplewhite, but are constructed with
more attention to the utilitarian side, with sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
conveniences, and with the fluted legs which Sheraton
generally uses. His designs show sideboards
also with ornamental brass rails at the back, holding
candelabra.</p>

<p>His desks and writing-tables are carefully and
minutely described, so that the manifold combinations
and contrivances can be accurately made.</p>

<p>Sheraton’s later furniture was heavy and generally
ugly, following the Empire fashions, and his fame
rests upon the designs in his first book. He was
the last of the great English cabinet-makers, although
he had many followers in England and in America.</p>

<p>After the early years of the nineteenth century,
the fashionable furniture was in the heavy, clumsy
styles which were introduced with the Empire, until
the period of ugly black walnut furniture which is
familiar to us all.</p>

<p>While there have always been a few who collected
antique furniture, the general taste for collecting
began with the interest kindled by the Centennial
Exposition in 1876. Not many years ago the collector
of old furniture and china was jeered at, and
one who would, even twenty years since, buy an old
“high-boy” rather than a new black walnut chiffonier,
was looked upon as “queer.” All that is
now changed. The chiffonier is banished for the
high-boy, when the belated collector can secure one,
and the influence of antique furniture may be seen
in the immense quantity of new furniture modelled
after the antique designs, but not made, alas, with
the care and thought for durability which were
bestowed upon furniture by the old cabinet-makers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Heaton says: “It appears to require about a
century for the wheel of fashion to make one
complete revolution. What our great-grandfather
bought and valued (1750-1790); what our grandfathers
despised and neglected (1790-1820); what
our fathers utterly forgot (1820-1850), we value,
restore, and copy!”</p>

<p>Since the publication of this book in 1902, many
old houses in this country have been restored by
different societies interested in the preservation of
antiquities. These historic houses have been carefully
and suitably furnished, thus carrying out what
should be our patriotic duty, the gathering and preserving
of everything connected with our history and
life. Thus much furniture has been rescued, not
only from unmerited oblivion, but from probable
destruction.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE chest was a
most important
piece of furniture
in households of
the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. It served
as table, seat, or trunk,
besides its accepted purpose
to hold valuables of
various kinds.</p>

<p>Chests are mentioned in
the earliest colonial inventories.
Ship chests, board
chests, joined chests, wainscot
chests with drawers,
and carved chests are some
of the entries; but the
larger portion are inventoried
simply as chests.</p>

<p>All woodwork&mdash;chests, stools, or tables&mdash;which
was framed together, chiefly with mortise and tenon,
was called joined, and joined chests and wainscot
chests were probably terms applied to panelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
chests to distinguish them from those of plain boards,
which were common in every household, and which
were brought to this country on the ships with the
colonists, holding their scanty possessions.</p>

<p>The oldest carved chests were made without
drawers beneath, and were carved in low relief in
designs which appear upon other pieces of oak furniture
of the same period.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i1">1</a> shows a chest now in Memorial
Hall, at Deerfield, which was taken from the house
where the Indians made their famous attack in 1704.
The top of the chest is missing, and the feet, which
were continuations of the stiles, are worn away or
sawed off. The design and execution of the carving
are unusually fine, combining several different patterns,
all of an early date. Chests were carved in
the arch design with three or four panels, but seldom
as elaborately as this, which was probably made
before 1650.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i2">2</a> shows a remarkable chest now
owned by Mrs. Caroline Foote Marsh of Claremont-on-the-James,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Virginia. Until recently it has
remained in the family of D’Olney Stuart, whose
ancestor, of the same name, was said to be of the
royal Stuart blood, and who brought it with him
when he fled to Virginia after the beheading of
Charles I.</p>

<p>The feet have been recently added, and should be
large balls; otherwise the chest is original in every
respect. It is made entirely of olive-wood, the body
being constructed of eight-inch planks. The decoration
is produced with carving and burnt work.
Upon the inside of the lid are three panels, the
centre one containing a portrait in burnt work
of James I. with his little dog by his side. The
two side panels portray the Judgment of Solomon,
the figures being clad in English costumes; in the left
panel the two kneeling women claim the child; in
the right the child is held up for the executioner to
carry out Solomon’s command to cut it in two. The
outside of the lid has the Stuart coat of arms burnt
upon it. Upon the front of the chest are four
knights, and between them are three panels, surrounded
by a moulding, which is now missing
around the middle panel. These three panels are
carved and burnt with views of castles; and around
the lock, above the middle panel, are carved the
British lions supporting the royal coat of arms.
The chest measures six feet in length and is twenty-four
inches high.</p>

<p>Chests with drawers are mentioned as early as
1650, and the greater number of chests found in
New England have one or two drawers.</p>

this style have been found there, chiefly in Hartford
County. The top, back, and bottom are of pine,
the other portions of the chest being of American
oak. The design of the carving is similar upon all
these chests, and the turned drop ornament upon
the stiles, and the little egg-shaped pieces upon the
drawers, appear upon all. They have been found
with one or two drawers or none, but usually with
two. This chest is in Memorial Hall, at Deerfield.</p>

<p>A number of chests carved in a manner not seen
elsewhere have been found in and about Hadley,
Massachusetts, and this has given them the name of
Hadley chests. The carving in all is similar, upon

three panels above the drawers, with initials carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

conventionalized tulip design, which is carved upon
the rest of the front, in low relief. The carving
is usually stained while the background is left the

the collection of the late Major Ben: Perley Poore,
at Indian Hill. Such chests upon frames are rarely
found, and by some they are supposed to have been
made for use as desks; but it seems more probable
that they were simple chests for linen, taking the
place of the high chest of drawers which was gradually
coming into fashion during the latter half of
the seventeenth century, and possibly being its forerunner.
Chests continued in manufacture and in
use until after 1700, but they were probably not
made later than 1720 in any numbers, as several
years previous to that date they were inventoried as
“old,” a word which was as condemnatory in those
years as now, as far as the fashions were concerned.</p>

<p>Chests of drawers appear in inventories about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
1645. They were usually made of oak and were
similar in design to the chests of that period.</p>

<p>The oak chest of drawers in Illustration <a href="#i9">9</a> is
owned by E. R. Lemon, Esq., of the Wayside Inn,
Sudbury. It has four drawers, and the decoration is
simply panelling. The feet are the large balls which

unusual design, the drop being of bell-flower shape.
This chest of drawers was found in Malden.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 9.&mdash;Panelled Chest of Drawers, about 1680.</p>
</div>

<p>From the time that high chests of drawers were
introduced, during the last part of the seventeenth
century, the use of oak in furniture gradually ceased,
and its place was taken by walnut or cherry, and
later by mahogany. With the disuse of oak came
a change in the style of chests, which were no longer
made in the massive panelled designs of earlier years.</p>

<p>The moulding around the drawers is somewhat
of a guide to the age of a piece of furniture. The
earliest moulding was large and single, upon the
frame around the drawers. The next moulding consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of two strips, forming a double moulding.
These strips were in some cases separated by a plain
band about half an inch in width.</p>

<p>Later still, upon
block front pieces a small single moulding bordered
the frame around the drawers, while upon Hepplewhite
and Sheraton furniture the moulding was upon
the drawer itself. Early in the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
about 1720, high chests were
made with no moulding
about the drawers, the edges
of which lapped over the

<p>Another guide to the age
of a piece of furniture made
with drawers is found in the
brass handles, which are
shown in Illustration 11 in
the different styles in use
from 1675. The handle and
escutcheon lettered A, called
a “drop handle,” was used
upon six-legged high chests,
and sometimes upon chests.
The drop may be solid or
hollowed out in the back.
The shape of the plate and
escutcheon varies, being
round, diamond, or shield
shaped, cut in curves or
points upon the edges, and
generally stamped. It is
fastened to the drawer front
by a looped wire, the ends
of which pass through a hole
in the wood and are bent in
the inside of the drawer.</p>

<p>A handle and escutcheon of the next style are
lettered B. They are found upon six-legged and
early bandy-legged high chests. The plate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
handle is of a type somewhat earlier than the escutcheon.
Both are stamped, and the bail of the
handle is fastened
with looped wires.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 12.&mdash;Six-legged <br />High Chest of Drawers,<br />

</div>

<p>Letter C shows
the earliest styles
of handles with
the bail fastened
into bolts which
screw into the
drawer. Letters
D, E, and F give
the succeeding
styles of brass
handles, the design
growing more
elaborate and increasing
in size.
These are found
upon desks, chests
of drawers, commodes,
and other
pieces of furniture
of the Chippendale
period.</p>

<p>The earliest
form of high chest
of drawers had six
turned legs, four
in front and two in the back, with stretchers between
the legs, and was of Dutch origin, as well as the high
chest with bandy or cabriole legs, which was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
years later in date. Six-legged chests were made
during the last quarter of the seventeenth century,
and were usually of walnut, either solid or veneered
upon pine or whitewood; other woods were rarely
employed.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <p class="cf">Illus. 13.&mdash;Walnut Dressing-table,<br />
about 1700.</p>
</div>

<p>The earliest six-legged chests were made
with the single moulding upon the frame about the
drawers, and with two drawers at the top, which was
always flat, as the broken arch did not appear in
furniture until about 1730. The lower part had
but one long drawer, and
the curves of the lower
edge were in a single
arch.</p>

<p>The six-legged high
chest of drawers in Illustration
<a href="#i12">12</a> belongs to
F. A. Robart, Esq., of
Boston. It is veneered
with the walnut burl and
is not of the earliest type
of the six-legged chest,
but was made about
1705-1715. The handles are the drop handles
shown in letter A, and the moulding upon the
frame around the drawers is double. There is a
shallow drawer in the heavy cornice at the top, and
the lower part contains three drawers.</p>

<p>Dressing-tables were made to go with these chests
of drawers, but with four instead of six legs. Their
tops were usually veneered, and they were, like the
high chests, finished with a small beading around
the curves of the lower edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The dressing-table in Illustration <a href="#i13">13</a> also belongs
to Mr. Robart, and shows the style in which that
piece of furniture was made.</p>

<p>The names “high-boy” and “low-boy” or “high-daddy”
and “low-daddy” are not mentioned in
old records and were probably suggested by the
appearance of the chests mounted upon their high
legs.</p>

</div>

<p>High chests, both six-legged and bandy-legged,
with their dressing-tables were sometimes decorated
with the lacquering which was so fashionable during
the first part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i14">14</a> shows a dressing-table or low-boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
from the Bolles collection in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. It is covered with japanning,
in Chinese designs. This dressing-table is the
companion to a lacquered high-boy, with a flat
top, in the Bolles collection. The handle is like
letter C, in Illustration <a href="#i11">11</a>. That and the moulding
around the drawers place its date about 1720.</p>

<p>Coming originally from the Orient, japanned
furniture became fashionable, and consequently
the process of lacquering or japanning was practised
by cabinet-makers in France and England
about 1700, and soon after in this country.</p>

<p>The earliest high chests with cabriole or bandy
legs are flat-topped, and have two short drawers,
like the six-legged chests, at the top. They are
made of walnut, or of pine veneered with walnut.
The curves at the lower edge are similar to those
upon six-legged chests and are occasionally finished
with a small bead-moulding.</p>

</div>

<p>The bandy-legged high-boy in Illustration <a href="#i15">15</a> is
owned by Dwight Blaney, Esq. It is veneered with
walnut and has a line of whitewood inlaid around
each drawer. The moulding upon the frame surrounding
the drawers is the separated double moulding,
and the handles are of the early stamped type
shown in Illustration <a href="#i11">11</a>, letter B. The arrangement
of drawers in both lower and upper parts is the same
as in six-legged chests. A reminder of the fifth
and sixth legs is left in the turned drops between the
curves of the lower edge.</p>

<p>Steps to display china or earthenware were in use
during the second quarter of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>They were generally movable pieces, made like the
steps in Illustration <a href="#i15">15</a>, in two or three tiers, the
lower tier smaller
than the top of the
high chest, forming
with the chest-top
a set of graduated
shelves upon the
front and sides.</p>

<p>The broken arch,
which had been used
in chimney pieces
during the seventeenth
century, made
its appearance upon
furniture in the early
years of the eighteenth
century, and
the handsomest
chests were made
with the broken arch
top.</p>

<p>A lacquered or
japanned high-boy in
the Bolles collection,
owned by the Metropolitan
Museum of
Art, is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i16">16</a>. It is of
later date than the
lacquered dressing-table in Illustration <a href="#i14">14</a>, having
the broken arch. The lacquering is inferior in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
design to that upon the dressing-table, and at the
top is a scroll design following the outline of the
top drawers and
the moulding of
the broken arch.</p>

<p>A large and a small
fan are lacquered
upon the lower
middle drawer,
and on the upper
one is a funny little
pagoda top, with
a small fan, both
in lacquer. The
handles are of an
early type, and the
moulding around
the drawers is a
double separated
one. Such japanned
pieces are
rare and of great
value.</p>

<p>A fine high chest
is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i17">17</a>, from
the Warner house
in Portsmouth.
It is of walnut
and is inlaid
around each drawer. The upper middle drawer is
inlaid in a design of pillars with the rising sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
between them, and below the sun are inlaid the
initials J. S. and the date 1733.</p>

<p>The lower drawer
has a star inlaid between
the pillars,
and a star is inlaid
upon each end of
the case. The
knobs at the top
are inlaid with the
star, and the middle
knob ends in a
carved flame.</p>

<p>J. S. was John
Sherburne, whose
son married the
daughter of Colonel
Warner. The legs
of this chest were
ruthlessly sawed off
many years ago, in
order that it might
stand in a low-ceilinged
room, and it
is only in comparatively
recent years
that it has belonged
to the branch of the
family now owning
the Warner house.
A double moulding runs upon the frame around
the drawers, and the original handles were probably
small, of the type in Illustration <a href="#i11">11</a>, letter C.</p>

<p>A walnut high chest of a somewhat later type is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i18">18</a>, belonging to Mrs. Rufus
Woodward of Worcester. It is of walnut veneered
upon pine, and the
shells upon the upper
and lower middle
drawers are gilded,
for they are, of course,
carved from the pine
beneath the veneer.
The frame has the
separated double
moulding around the
drawers. A row of
light inlaying extends
around each drawer,
and in the three long
drawers of the upper
part the inlaying simulates
the division
into two drawers,
which is carried out
in the top drawers of
both the upper and
lower parts. The large
handles and the fluted
columns at the sides
would indicate that
this chest was made
about 1760-1770.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i19">19</a> shows a “high-boy” and “low-boy”
of walnut, owned by the writer. The drawers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
it will be seen, lap over the frame. The “high-boy”
is original in every respect except the ring handles,
which are new, upon the drawers carved with the
rising sun or fan design.</p>

<p>It was found in the attic
of an old house, with
the top separate from
the lower part and
every drawer out upon
the floor, filled with
seeds, rags, and&mdash;kittens,
who, terrified by
the invasion of the antique
hunter, scurried
from their resting-places,
to the number
of nine or ten, reminding
one of Lowell’s
lines in the “Biglow
Papers”:&mdash;</p>

of the small drawers were the torches for the upper
and the acorn-shaped drops for the lower part.
These drops were used as long as the curves followed
those of the lower part of six-legged chests, but were
omitted when more graceful curves and lines were
used, as the design of high chests gradually differed
from the early types.</p>

<p>The “low-boy,” or dressing-table, was made to
accompany every style of high chest. The low-boy
in Illustration <a href="#i19">19</a> shows the dressing-table which
was probably used in the room with the bandy-legged
high-boy, flat-topped or with the broken
arch cornice. It is lower than the under part
of the high-boy, which is, however, frequently supplied
with a board top and sold as a low-boy, but
which can be easily detected from its height and
general appearance. The measurements of this high-boy
and low-boy are</p>

<p>High chests and dressing-tables were made of
maple, often very beautifully marked, in the same
style as the chests of
walnut and cherry.
The high chest was
sometimes made
with the drawers extending
nearly to the
floor, and mounted
upon bracket, ogee,
or claw-and-ball
feet. This was called
a double chest, or
chest-upon-chest.</p>

<p>The double chest
in Illustration <a href="#i20">20</a> is
in the Warner house
at Portsmouth. It
is of English walnut,
and the lower
part is constructed
with a recessed cupboard
like the writing-table
in Illustration
<a href="#i106">106</a>. The
handles upon this
chest are very massive,
and upon the
ends of both the
upper and lower parts are still larger handles with
which to lift the heavy chest.</p>

<p>A double chest which was probably made in Newport,
Rhode Island, about 1760-1770, is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i21">21</a>. The lower part is blocked and is
carved in the same beautiful shells as Illustration 31
and Illustration 106. This double chest was made
for John Brown of Providence, the leader of the
party who captured the <i>Gaspee</i> in 1772, and one
of the four famous Brown brothers, whose name
is perpetuated in Brown University. This chest is
now owned by a descendant of John Brown, John
Brown Francis Herreshoff, Esq., of New York.</p>

109 specified a dressing-table, brought from
England to this house in 1716, but so early a date
cannot be assigned to this piece, although it is undoubtedly
English, like the double chair in Illustration
212, which has similar feet, for such lions’ feet
are almost never
found upon furniture
made in this
country.</p>

<p>The shape
of the cabriole leg
is poor, the curves
being too abrupt,
but the general effect
of the low-boy
is very rich. The
handles are the original
ones, and they
with the fluted columns
and blocked
front determine the
date of the dressing-table
to be about 175O.</p>

<p>The low-boy in
Illustration <a href="#i23">23</a> is
probably of slightly later date. It has the separated
double moulding upon the frame around the
drawers, and the curves of the lower part are like
the early high chests, but the carving upon the cabriole
legs, and the fluted columns at the corners, like
those in Chippendale’s designs, indicate that it was
made after 1750. Upon the top are two pewter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
lamps, one with glass lenses to intensify the light; a
smoker’s tongs, and a pipe-case of mahogany, with
a little drawer in it to hold the tobacco. This dressing-table

<p>The little chest of drawers in Illustration <a href="#i24">24</a>
belongs to Daniel Gilman, Esq., of Exeter, New
Hampshire, and was inherited by him. It is evidently
adapted from the high-boy, in order to make
a smaller and lower piece, and it is about the size
of a small bureau. The upper part is separate
from the lower part, and is set into a moulding, just
as the upper part of a high-boy sets into the lower.
The handles and the moulding around the drawers
are of the same period as the ones upon the chest

<p>The furniture made in and around Philadelphia
was much more elaborately carved and richly ornamented
than that of cabinet-makers further
north, and the finest tables, high-boys, and low-boys
that are found were probably made there. They
have large handles, like letter F, in Illustration <a href="#i11">11</a>,
and finely carved applied scrolls.</p>

<p>The richest and most elaborate style attained in
such pieces of furniture is shown in the high chest in
Illustration <a href="#i25">25</a>, which is one of the finest high chests
known. The proportions are perfect, and the carving
is all well executed. This chest was at one time in
the Pendleton collection, and is now owned by Harry
Harkness Flagler, Esq., of Millbrook, New York.</p>

<p>Such a chest as this was in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s
mind when he wrote: “After all, the moderns
have invented nothing better in chamber furniture
than those chests which stand on four slender legs,
and send an absolute tower of mahogany to the ceiling,
the whole terminating in a fantastically carved
summit.”</p>

<p>The dressing-table and looking-glass in Illustration
<a href="#i26">26</a> are also owned by Mr. Flagler. The
looking-glass is described upon page <a href="#Page_385">385</a>. The
dressing-table is a beautiful and dainty piece of furniture
of the same high standard as the chest last
described. The carving upon the cabriole legs
is unusually elaborate and well done. It will be
noticed that the lower edge of these pieces is no
longer finished in the simple manner of the earlier
high-boys and low-boys, but is cut in curves, which
vary with each piece of furniture.</p>

<p>In Illustration <a href="#i365">365</a> upon page <a href="#Page_378">378</a> is a low-boy of
walnut, owned by the writer, of unusually graceful
proportions, the
carved legs being
extremely slender.
The shell
upon this low-boy
is carved in
the frame below
the middle drawer
instead of upon
it, as is usual.</p>

<p>The dressing-table
in Illustration
<a href="#i27">27</a> also
belongs to the
writer. It is of
walnut, like the
majority of similar
pieces, and is
finely carved but
is not so graceful
as Illustration

are the original
ones and are very
large and handsome.</p>

<p>Hepplewhite’s book, published in 1789,
contains designs for chests of drawers, extending
nearly to the floor, with bracket feet, one having
fluted columns at the corners, and an urn with garlands
above the flat top. It is probable, however,
that high chests of drawers were not made in any
number after 1790.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE word “bureau”
is now used to designate
low chests of
drawers. Chippendale
called such pieces “commode
tables” or “commode
bureau tables.” As desks with
slanting lids for a long period
during the eighteenth century
were called “bureaus” or
“bureau desks,” the probability
is that chests of drawers
which resembled desks in the
construction of the lower
part went by the name of
“bureau tables” because of the flat table-top.
Hepplewhite called such pieces “commodes” or
“chests of drawers.” As the general name by
which they are now known is “bureau,” it has
seemed simpler to call them so in this chapter.</p>

<p>Bureaus were made of mahogany, birch, or cherry,
and occasionally of maple, while a few have been
found of rosewood. Walnut was not used in serpentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or swell front bureaus, although walnut
chests of drawers are not uncommon, which look
like the top part of a high chest, with bracket feet,
and handles of an early design; and so far as the
writer’s observation goes, few bureaus with three
or four drawers were made of walnut.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 28.&mdash;Block-front Bureau, about 1770.</p>
</div>

<p>The wood usually employed in the finest bureaus
is mahogany, and the earliest ones are small, with
the serpentine, block, or straight front, and with the
top considerably larger than the body, projecting
nearly an inch and a half over the front and sides, the
edge shaped like the drawer fronts. The early
handles are large and like letter E in Illustration <a href="#i11">11</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The block front is, like the serpentine or yoke
front, carved from one thick board. It is found
more frequently in this country than in England.
The block-front bureau in Illustration <a href="#i28">28</a> is owned by
Dwight M. Prouty, Esq., of Boston, and is a very
good example, with the original handles.</p>

</div>

<p>The small bureau in Illustration <a href="#i29">29</a> is in the
Warner house in Portsmouth. It is of mahogany,
with an unusual form of block front, the blocking
being rounded. The shape of the board top corresponds
to the curves upon the front of the drawers.
The handles are large, and upon each end is a massive
handle to lift the bureau by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i30">30</a> shows a block-front bureau owned
by the writer. Chippendale gives a design of a bureau
similar to this, with three drawers upon rather
high legs, under the name of “commode table.”</p>

<p>The height of the legs brings the level of the bureau
top about the same as one with four drawers. One
handle and one escutcheon were remaining upon
this bureau, and the others were cast from them.
The block front with its unusually fine shells would
indicate that this piece, which came from Colchester,
Connecticut, was made by the same Newport cabinet-maker
as the writing-table in Illustration <a href="#i106">106</a>, and
the double chest in Illustration <a href="#i21">21</a>, which were
made about 1765. The looking-glass in the illustration
is described upon page <a href="#Page_410">410</a>.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i31">31</a> shows a mahogany bureau of the
style known as “kettle” shape, owned by Charles
R. Waters, Esq., of Salem. Desks and secretaries
were occasionally made with the lower part in this
style, and many modern pieces of Dutch marqueterie
with kettle fronts are sold as antiques. But little
marqueterie furniture was brought to this country
in old times, and even among the descendants of
Dutch families in New York State it is almost
impossible to find
any genuine old
pieces of Dutch
marqueterie.</p>

<p>A bureau with
serpentine front is
shown in Illustration
<a href="#i32">32</a>. It is made
in two sections, the
upper part with four
drawers being set
into the moulding
around the base in
the same manner as
the top part of a
high-boy sets into the lower part. The bureau is
owned by Charles Sibley, Esq., of Worcester.</p>

<p>The bureaus described so far all have the small
single moulding upon the frame around the drawer.
From the time when the designs of Shearer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Hepplewhite became fashionable, bureaus were made
with a fine bead moulding upon the edge of the
drawer itself or without any moulding.</p>

<p>The serpentine-front bureau in Illustration <a href="#i33">33</a>
belongs to Mrs. Johnson-Hudson of Stratford,
Connecticut. The corners are cut off so as to
form the effect of a narrow pillar, which is, like the
drawers and the bracket feet, inlaid with fine lines
of holly. The bracket feet and the handles would
indicate that this bureau was made before 1789.</p>

<p>A bureau of the finest Hepplewhite type is shown
in Illustration <a href="#i34">34</a>, owned by Mrs. Charles H. Carroll
of Worcester. The base has the French foot which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was so much used by Hepplewhite, which is entirely
different from Chippendale’s French foot. The
curves of the lower edge, which are outlined with a
line of holly, are unusually graceful; the knobs are
brass.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i35">35</a> shows the styles of handles chiefly
found upon pieces of furniture with drawers, after
1770. A is a handle which was used during the
last years of the Chippendale period, and the first
years of the Hepplewhite. B and C are the oval
pressed brass handles found upon Hepplewhite furniture.
They were made round as well as oval, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were in various designs; the
eagle with thirteen stars, a serpent,
a beehive, a spray of
flowers, or heads of historic personages&mdash;Washington
and Jefferson
being the favorites.</p>

<p>D is
the rosette and ring handle, of
which E shows an elaborate form.
These handles were used upon
Sheraton pieces and also upon
the heavy veneered mahogany
furniture made during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century.
F is the brass knob
handle used from 1800 to 1820.
G is the glass knob which, in
clear and opalescent glass, came
into use about 1815 and which
is found upon furniture made
for twenty years after that date,
after which time wooden knobs
were used, often displacing the
old brass handles.</p>

<p>Looking-glasses made to
swing in a frame are mentioned
in inventories of 1750, and about
that date may be given to the
dressing-glass with drawers,
shown in Illustration <a href="#i36">36</a>. It was
owned by Lucy Flucker, who
took it with her when, in opposition
to her parents’ wishes, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
married in 1774 the patriot General Knox. It is
now in the possession of the Hon. James Phinney
Baxter, Esq., of Portland, Maine. Such dressing-glasses
were intended
to stand upon a dressing-table
or bureau.</p>

<p>A bureau and dressing-glass
owned by
the writer are shown
in Illustration <a href="#i37">37</a>.
The bureau is of
cherry, with the
drawer fronts veneered
in mahogany
edged with satinwood.
A row of fine inlaying
runs around the
edge of the top and
beneath the drawers.
This lower line of inlaying
appears upon
inexpensive bureaus
of this period, and
seems to have been
considered indispensable
to the finish of
a bureau. The dressing-glass is of mahogany and
satinwood with fine inlaying around the frame of
the glass and the edge of the stand. The base
of the bureau is of a plain type, while that of the
dressing-glass has the same graceful curves that
appear in Illustration <a href="#i34">34</a>.</p>

<p>The bureaus in Illustration <a href="#i34">34</a> and Illustration <a href="#i37">37</a>
are in the Hepplewhite style. The bureau and
dressing-glass in Illustration <a href="#i38">38</a> are distinctly Sheraton,
of the best style. They are owned by Dwight
Blaney, Esq., of Boston, and were probably made
about 1810. The carving upon the bureau legs
and upon the corners and side supports to the
dressing-glass is
finely executed.
The handles to
the drawers are
brass knobs.</p>

<p>A bureau of
the same date is
shown in Illustration
<a href="#i39">39</a>. It
was owned originally
by William
F. Lane,
Esq., of Boston.
Mr. Lane had
several children,
for whom he had
miniature pieces
of furniture
made, the little
sofa in Illustration
<a href="#i228">228</a> being
one. The small
bureau upon the
top of the large one was part of a bedroom set,
which included a tiny four-post bedstead.</p>

<p>This miniature furniture was of mahogany like the large
pieces. The handles upon the large bureau are not
original. They should be rosette and ring, or knobs
similar to those upon the small bureau. The bureaus
are now owned
by a daughter of
Mr. Lane, Mrs.
Thomas H. Gage
of Worcester.</p>

<p>Bureaus of
this style were
frequently made
of cherry with
the drawer fronts
of curly or bird’s-eye
maple, the
fluted pillars at
the corner and
the frame around
the drawers being
of cherry or
mahogany.</p>

<p>There was
added to the
bureau about this time&mdash;perhaps evolved from
the dressing-glass with drawers&mdash;an upper tier of
shallow drawers, usually three. The dressing-table
shown in Illustration <a href="#i40">40</a> is owned by Charles H.
Morse, Esq., of Charlestown, New Hampshire.
It stands upon high legs turned and reeded, and a
dressing-glass is attached above the three little
drawers. The handles should be rings or knobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The case of drawers with closet above, in Illustration
<a href="#i41">41</a>, is owned by Mrs. Thomas H. Gage, of
Worcester. It is of mahogany, the doors of the
closet being of especially handsome wood. The
carving at the top of the fluted legs is fine, and the
piece of furniture is massive and commodious.</p>

Mrs. Gage, and is a very good specimen of the furniture
in the heavy style fashionable during the first
quarter of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>It was probably made
to match a four-post
bedstead with twisted
posts surmounted
by pineapples. The
drawer fronts are veneered,
like those of
all the bureaus illustrated
in this chapter
except the first four,
and there is no
moulding upon the
edge of the drawers.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i43">43</a>
shows the heaviest
form of bureau, made
about the same time
as the last one shown,
with heavily carved
pillars and bears’
feet. The drawer
fronts are veneered
and have no moulding
upon the edge.
This bureau is owned
by Mrs. S. B. Woodward of Worcester, and it is a
fine example of the furniture after the style of Empire
pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The bureau in Illustration <a href="#i44">44</a> is owned by Charles
H. Morse, Esq., of Charlestown, and shows the
latest type of Empire bureau, with ball feet, and
large round veneered pillars. The three Empire
bureaus shown have the last touch that could
be added, a back piece above the tier of small
drawers.</p>

<p>The toilet conveniences of our ancestors seem to
our eyes most inadequate, and it is impossible that a
very free use of water was customary, with the tiny
bowls and pitchers which were used and the small
and inconvenient washstands. A “bason frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>”
appears in an inventory of 1654. Chippendale
designed “bason stands” which were simply a tripod
stand, into the top of which the basin fitted.</p>

<p>They were also called wig stands because they
were kept in the dressing-room where the fine gentleman
halted to remove his hat, and powder his wig.
The basin rested in the opening in the top, and in
the little drawers were kept the powder and other
accessories of the toilet. The depression in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
shelf was for the ewer, probably bottle shaped, to
rest in, after the gentleman had poured the water
into the basin, to dip his fingers in after powdering
his wig.</p>

<p>The charming little basin or wig stand in Illustration
<a href="#i45">45</a> is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The wood is mahogany
and the feet are a flattened
type of claw and
ball, giving the little stand,
with its basin and ewer,
some stability, unless an
unwary pointed toe should
be caught by the spreading
legs. The acanthus
leaf is carved on the knees,
and the chamfered corners
above have an applied
fret.</p>

<p>The drawings of Shearer,
Hepplewhite and Sheraton
show both square and
corner washstands of mahogany
with slender legs.</p>

<p>The washstand in Illustration
<a href="#i46">46</a> is of mahogany,
and differs from the usual corner stand in having
the enclosed cupboard. It was made from a Hepplewhite
design and is owned by Francis H. Bigelow,
Esq., of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The corner washstand in Illustration <a href="#i47">47</a> is owned
by the writer. It is of mahogany, and the drawers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are finely inlaid, probably after a Sheraton design.</p>

<p>The little towel-rack is of somewhat later date and is
made of maple, stained. The washbowl and pitcher
are dark-blue Staffordshire ware, with the well-known
design of the “Tomb of
Franklin” upon them.</p>

<p>While the corner washstand
possessed the virtues
of taking up but
little room, and being
out of the way, the latter
consideration must have
been keenly felt by those
who, with head thrust
into the corner, were
obliged to use it.</p>

<p>A square washstand
of more convenient
shape, but still constructed
for the small
bowl and pitcher, is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i48">48</a>.
It is of mahogany and is
in the style that was
used from 1815 to 1830.
This washstand is owned by Mrs. E. A. Morse of
Worcester.</p>

<p>Both corner and square washstands have an opening
in the top, into which was set the washbowl, and
two&mdash;sometimes three&mdash;small openings for the
little cups which were used to hold the soap.</p>

<p>Hepplewhite’s book, published in 1789, shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
designs of “night tables” like the one in Illustration

</div>

<p>A washstand of different design is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i50">50</a>. The front is of bird’s-eye maple and
mahogany, and the
top is of curly maple
with mahogany inlay
around the edge.
The sides are mahogany.
The two
drawers are shams,
and the top lifts on
a hinge disclosing a
compartment for a
pitcher and bowl.
The tapering legs
end in a spade foot,
and a large brass
handle is upon each
side. The other
handles are brass
knobs. This stand was made after instructions
given by Sheraton thus, “The advantage of this
kind of basin stand is, that they may stand in a
genteel room, without giving offense to the eye,
their appearance being somewhat like a cabinet.”
The washstand is owned by the writer.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">ONE of the most
valuable pieces of
furniture in the
household of the
seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was the
bedstead with its belongings.
Bedsteads and beds
occupy a large space in inventories,
and their valuation
was often far more
than that of any other article
in the inventory, sometimes
more than all the
others. In spite of the great value placed upon them,
none have survived to show us exactly what was meant
by the “oak Marlbrough bedstead” or the “half-headed
bedstead” in early inventories. About the bedstead
up to 1750 we know only what these inventories
tell us, but the inference is that bedsteads similar to
those in England at that time were also in use in the
colonies. The greater portion of the value of the
bedstead lay in its furnishings,&mdash;the hangings,
feather bed, bolster, quilts, blankets, and coverlid,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
bedstead proper, when inventoried separately,
being placed at so low a sum that one concludes it
must have been extremely
plain.</p>

<p>Several
cradles made in
the seventeenth century
are still in existence.
Illustration <a href="#i51">51</a>
shows one which is
in Pilgrim Hall,
Plymouth, and which
is said to have sheltered
Peregrine
White, the first child
born in this country

from Holland
upon the <i>Mayflower</i>,

<p>The cradle in
Illustration <a href="#i52">52</a> is
of more substantial
build. It is
of oak, and was
made for John
Coffin, who was
born in Newbury,
January 8, 1680.
Sergeant Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Jaques, “who built the meeting house with great
needles and little needles pointing downward,”
fashioned this cradle, whose worn rockers bear witness
to the many generations of babies who have
slept within its sturdy frame. It is now in the
rooms of the Newburyport Historical Society.</p>

<p>Another wooden cradle is in Pilgrim Hall, made
of oak and very similar, with the turned spindles at
the sides of its wooden hood, to a cradle dated 1691,
in the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>“Cupboard bedsteads” and “presse bedsteads”
are mentioned in the inventories. They were
probably the same as the Dutch “slaw-bank,” and
when not in use they were fastened up against the
wall in a closet made to fit the bed, and the closet
doors were closed or curtains were drawn over the
bedstead. There is a slaw-bank in the old Sumner
house in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, built in
1797.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i53">53</a> shows a curious bedstead made
about 1750, when it was used by Dr. Samuel Johnson,
president of King’s College, New York. It is
now owned by his descendant, Mrs. Johnson-Hudson
of Stratford, Connecticut. The slanting
back of the bedstead is like the back of an early
Chippendale chair, and the effect is similar to that
of the couches shown in Illustration <a href="#i205">205</a> and Illustration
<a href="#i206">206</a>; but this piece was evidently intended for a
bed, as it is considerably wider than the couches,
which were “day beds.” The wood of this bedstead
is mahogany. The commode which stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
beside the bed is of a slightly later date. It is also
of mahogany, with massive brass handles.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i54">54</a> shows a bedstead of about 1760-1770.
It is what was called a field bed, the
form of its top suggesting a tent. The frames
for the canopy top were made in different shapes,
but the one in the illustration was most common.
The drapery is made of the netted fringe so much
used in those days for edging bedspreads, curtains,
and covers. This deep fringe was made especially
for canopy tops for bedsteads. Its manufacture has
been revived by several Arts and Crafts Societies.
The slat-back chair is one of the rush-bottomed
variety common during the eighteenth century.
This room, with its wooden rafters, is in the
Whipple house at Ipswich, built in 1650.</p>

<p>The claw-and-ball foot bedstead in Illustration <a href="#i55">55</a>
was a part of the wedding outfit of Martha Tufts,
who was married in 1774, in Concord. It was then
hung with the printed cotton draperies, hand spun
and woven, which still hang from the tester, albeit
much darned and quite dropping apart with age.
The draperies are of a brownish color, possibly from
age, but at all events they are now dingy and unattractive,
whatever they may have been in 1774.
The posts above the cabriole legs are small and plain,
and there is no headboard. The wood is mahogany.
This bedstead is now owned by the Concord
Antiquarian Society. Although Chippendale’s designs
do not show a bedstead with claw-and-ball feet,
he probably did make such bedsteads, and this may
be called Chippendale, as it belongs to that period.</p>

<p>The

after
the fashion
which Hepplewhite

attractive.
It is at Indian
Hill, the
residence of
the late Major
Ben Perley
Poore.</p>

<p>The four-post
bedsteads
had
sometimes
canvas stretched across the frame and laced with
ropes, similar to the seat of the couch in Illustration
<a href="#i206">206</a>, and in other cases they were corded entirely
with ropes. Mrs. Vanderbilt in her “Social History
of Flatbush” thus describes the process of cording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a bed: “It required a man’s strength to turn the
machine that tightened the ropes, in cording these
beds when they were put together. Some one was
stationed at each post to keep it upright, while a man
was exhausting his strength and perhaps his stock
of patience and good temper, in getting the ropes
sufficiently tight to suit the wife or mother. When
the bedstead was duly corded and strung to the tension
required, then a straw bed, in a case of brown
home-made linen, was first placed over these cords,
and upon this were piled feather beds to the number
of three or four, and more if this was the spare-room
bed.” The height of the top one of these feather
beds from the floor was so great that steps were required
to mount into it, and sets of mahogany steps
are sometimes found now, which were made for this
purpose. A set is shown in Illustration <a href="#i64">64</a>.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i59">59</a> shows one of the finest bedsteads
known in this country. It is in the house of Charles
R. Waters, Esq., of Salem. The two lower posts
are exquisitely carved with garlands of flowers, and
every detail is beautiful; the upper posts are plain.
The size of the posts is somewhat larger than during
the previous years, and the style of the lower part
with the fluted leg would place the date of the bedstead
about 1795-1800, when the influence of Sheraton
was strong. The cornice is painted with flowers
in colors, and the painted band is framed in gilt; the
ornaments at the corners, the basket with two doves,
and the ropes and tassels are all of gilt.</p>

<p>About 1800, when the Empire styles commenced
to influence the makers of furniture, the posts of
bedsteads became larger, and they were more heavily
carved, with acanthus leaves twining around the post,
or a heavy twist or fluting, with pineapples at the
top.</p>

finely grained old walnut, the rounding top of the
head and foot boards and the face of the large
drawer under the footboard being veneered. This
drawer may have been intended to use to keep
blankets in. It has a little foot so that it remains
firm when pulled out. At each side of the low bed
is a carved shell, which slides out, showing a covered
rest, perhaps for kneeling upon to pray. Both the
head and foot boards are covered with canvas, which
was probably, when the bedstead was new, about
1830, covered with a rich brocade. All the lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the bedstead are most graceful, and the carving is
unusually well done. Plainer bedsteads in this style
were made, veneered with mahogany, and they are
sometimes called sleigh beds, on account of their
shape. These bedsteads were fashionable from 1830
to 1850, when they were superseded by the black
walnut bedsteads familiar to everybody.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">CUPBOARDS
appear in English
inventories
as early as 1344.
Persons of rank in England
had their cupboards
surmounted by a set of
shelves to display the
silver and gold plate.
Each shelf was narrower
than the one beneath,
like a set of steps, and
the number of shelves
indicated the rank of the
owner, five being the
greatest number, to be used by the king only.</p>

<p>The first cupboard consisted of an open framework,
a “borde” upon which to set cups, as the
name implies. Later it was partially enclosed below,
and this enclosed cupboard was used to hold valuables,
or sometimes the food which was afterward
distributed by the lady of the house. This was
known as an almery or press cupboard, the former
name corresponding to the French word <i>armoire</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The names “court cupboard” or “livery cupboard”
were used to designate a piece of furniture without an
enclosed cupboard, low or short, as the French word
<i>court</i> implies, and intended for a serving-table, as the
word “livery,” from the French <i>livrer</i>, to deliver,
indicates. In Europe such pieces were called <i>dressoirs</i>.</p>

<p>Cupboards abound in colonial inventories, under
various names&mdash;“small cupboard,” “great cupboard,”
“press cupboard,” “wainscot cupboard,”
“court cupboard,” “livery cupboard,” “hanging
cupboard,” “sideboard cupboard.” The cupboard
formed an important part of the furniture owned by
men of wealth and position in the colonies.</p>

<p>These cupboards were generally of oak, but those
made in this country have the backs and bottoms
of the cupboards and drawers of pine. The interior
is similar in all, the lower cupboard usually having

Sometimes the lower part of the piece is
divided into drawers for holding linen.</p>

<p>Such a cupboard is shown in Illustration <a href="#i68">68</a>.
This fine example is known as the “Putnam cupboard.”
It is now owned by the Essex Institute,
of Salem, to which it was presented by Miss Harriet
Putnam Fowler of Danvers, Massachusetts. It
descended to her from John Putnam, who brought
it from England about 1640. Upon the back may
be seen marks of a fire which two hundred years
ago destroyed the house in which the cupboard
stood. The wood is English oak, and the mouldings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
used in the panelling are of cedar. The cupboard
is in two parts, the upper section with the
enclosed cupboard
resting
upon the lower
section with its
three drawers.</p>

<p>Another
panelled cupboard
is shown
in Illustration
<a href="#i69">69</a>, in which
both the upper
and lower parts
are made with
a recessed
cupboard, enclosed,
with a
drawer below.
The wood is
oak, with the
turned pieces
painted black.
This cupboard
is in the house
of Charles R.
Waters, Esq.,
of Salem. Upon the top are displayed some good
pieces of old glass.</p>

<p>Many press cupboards were carved in designs
similar to those upon the early chests. Illustration
<a href="#i70">70</a> shows a carved press cupboard owned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

</div>

<p>The wood
is American oak and the cupboard was probably
made in Connecticut, where there must have been
unusually good cabinet-makers during the last half
of the seventeenth century, for many of the best
oak chests and cupboards existing in this country
were made in Connecticut. This cupboard is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
large, measuring five feet in height and four feet
in width.</p>

<p>All cupboards were provided with cupboard cloths
or cushions, the latter probably made somewhat
thicker than the simple cloth, by the use of several
layers of goods or of stuffing. These cloths or
cushions were placed on the top of the cupboard, to
set the glass or silver upon, and the early inventories
have frequent mention of them. By 1690 the press
cupboard had gone out of fashion, and but few were
made after 1700, although they continued to be
used by those who already owned them.</p>

<p>About 1710 the corner cupboard made its appearance,
often under the name “beaufet” or “beaufatt.”
It was generally built into the corner, and
was finished to correspond with the panelling around
the room. The lower part was closed by panelled
doors, and the upper part had sometimes one glass
door, sometimes two, opening in the middle; but
more often it was left without a door. The top of
the beaufatt was usually made in the form of an apse,
and in the finest specimens the apse was carved in a
large shell. The shelves were not made to take
up the entire space in the cupboard, but extended
around the back, and were cut in curves and projections,
evidently to fit pieces of glass or china, for
the display of which the beaufatt was built rather
than to serve as a simple closet. A fine beaufatt is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i71">71</a>, which is in the Deerfield
Museum. From the construction of the pillars at
the side it is evident that it was not intended to use
a door to the upper part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>That there was some distinction between the
corner cupboard and the beaufatt would appear
from the difference in their valuation in inventories,
but what was the difference in their construction we
do not know.</p>

</div>

<p>Cupboards were
made, during the
latter part of
the eighteenth
century, of mahogany
and other
woods, and such
corner cupboards,
made as
a piece of furniture
and not built
into the house,
were common
in the Southern
States, about
1800. The corner
cupboard, or
beaufatt, was
both convenient
and ornamental,
taking up but
little room and
filling what was
often an empty
space. Our ancestors
frequently
utilized the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
chimney also, by making the sides into small closets
or cupboards, and occasionally a door with glass
panes was set into the chimney above the mantel,
with shelves behind it to hold glass or china.</p>

<p>While the New England inventories speak of cupboards,
the word <i>kas</i>, or <i>kasse</i>, appears in Dutch inventories
in New York. The kas was the Dutch
cupboard, and was different in style from the
cupboard in use in New England. It was of great
size, and had large doors, behind which were wide
shelves to hold linen. The kas was usually made
in two parts, the upper one having two doors and
a heavy cornice above. The lower part held a
long drawer, and rested upon large ball feet. A panelled
kas of somewhat different form is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i72">72</a>, without the ball feet, and made in
three parts; the lower section with the drawer, the
middle cupboard section, enclosed with large doors,
and a second cupboard above that, the whole surmounted
with a cornice. This kas is made of kingwood,
a hard wood with a grain not unlike that of
oak, but with darker markings. The bill of lading
is still preserved, dated 1701, when the kas, packed
full of fine linen, was imported from Holland by the
father of Dr. Samuel Johnson, president of King’s
College from 1754 to 1763. It is now owned by
Dr. Johnson’s descendant, Mrs. Johnson-Hudson
of Stratford, Connecticut.</p>

<p>Inventories during the latter years of the seventeenth
century speak of a “sideboard cupboard,”
“sideboard table,” and “side-table,” but the sideboard,
in our acceptance of the word, dates to the
latter half of the eighteenth century. Chippendale
designed no sideboards with drawers and compartments,
but he did design side-tables, or sideboard
tables, with marble or mahogany tops and carved
frames. A Chippendale side-table is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i73">73</a>. The wood is mahogany, and the frame
is carved elaborately and beautifully in designs similar
to those of Chippendale and his contemporaries,
which abound in flowers, birds, and shells. The
cabriole legs end in massive lion’s paws. This
table is what is called Irish Chippendale.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="cf">Illus. 73.&mdash;Chippendale Side-table, about 1755.</p>
</div>

<p>In Ireland, working at the same period as Chippendale,
drawing their ideas from the same sources,
and probably from Chippendale as well, were cabinet-makers,
much of whose work has come down, notably
side-tables. The shell plays a prominent part; on
this table beside the large shell are two small ones
upon each leg. The carving of the Irish school
is not so fine as its English model, but is very rich.
This table is five feet long and the original top was
of marble. It is owned by Harry Harkness Flagler,
Esq., of Millbrook, New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>A Chippendale side-table is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i74">74</a>, which was evidently made in England, from
Chippendale’s designs, if not by Chippendale himself.
It is very long and has had to sustain a great
weight in the heavy marble top, but it is in splendid
condition, perhaps because it is so heavy that it
is seldom moved. It has passed through many
vicissitudes,&mdash;war, fire and earthquake,&mdash;in
Charleston, South Carolina, since it was brought
there by the ancestor of its present owner, George
W. Holmes, Esq., of Charleston.</p>

<p>These long side-tables were designed not only by
Chippendale, but by the other cabinet-makers and
designers of the day, Ince and Mayhew, and Manwaring;
but the tables of these less noted men
usually are made after the prevailing Chinese style,
with applied fretwork and legs which are pierced,
thus depriving them of the strength necessary in so
large a piece. Chippendale made these also, but
in this table the cabinet-maker chose a design which
looks and is strong. The carving is in scrolls done
in the solid wood, and is French in design. The
bracket at the top of the leg is made in a scroll,
which extends entirely around the table.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of a sideboard, the description
of which implies a form of construction similar
to that of the later sideboard, is in 1746, when an
advertisement in a London newspaper speaks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
“a Large marble Sideboard Table with Lavatory
and Bottle Cistern.” Chippendale’s designs, published
in 1753 and 1760, contain nothing answering
to this description, and both he and other cabinet-makers
of that period give drawings of side-tables
only, without even a drawer beneath. Such a sideboard
as this advertisement of 1746 mentions, may
have given the idea from which, forty years later,
was developed the sideboard of mahogany, often inlaid,
with slender legs and curved front, which is
shown in the majority of antique shops as “Chippendale,”
while the heavy veneered sideboard, with
claw feet and compartments extending nearly to the
floor, made after 1800, goes under the name of
“Colonial.” One name is as incorrect as the other.
Thomas Shearer, an English cabinet-maker, designed
the first of the slender-legged sideboards, and they
appear in his drawings published in 1788. Hepplewhite’s
book, published in 1789, gave similar drawings,
as did Sheraton’s in 1791, and these three
cabinet-makers designed the sideboards which were
so fashionable from 1789 to 1805. The majority
which are found in this country were probably made
here, but one is shown in Illustration <a href="#i75">75</a>, which has
a most romantic history of travel and adventure.
It is in the half-circle shape which was Shearer’s
favorite design, and was probably of English make,
although it was brought from France to America.</p>

<p>In 1792 the ship <i>Sally</i>, consigned to Colonel
Swan, sailed from France, laden with rich furniture,
tapestries, robes, everything gathered together in
Paris which might have belonged to a royal lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 75.&mdash;Shearer Sideboard and Knife-box, 1792.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Sally</i> came to Wiscasset, Maine, and the story
told “down East” is that there was a plot to rescue
Marie Antoinette, and the <i>Sally</i> was laden for that
purpose; and that a house had been built in a
Maine seaport for the queen, whose execution put
an end to the plot, and sent the <i>Sally</i> off to America
with her rich cargo. I cannot help thinking that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the story be true, Marie Antoinette was spared many
weary days of discontent and homesickness; for the
temperament of the unfortunate queen, luxury loving,
gay, and heedless, does not fit into the life of
a little Maine seaport town one hundred years ago.
When the <i>Sally</i> arrived, her cargo of beautiful things
was sold. Legends of Marie Antoinette furniture
crop up all around the towns in the neighborhood
of Wiscasset, but, singularly enough, I have been
unable to trace a single piece in Maine except this
sideboard. Miss Elizabeth Bartol of Boston, whose
mother was a granddaughter of Colonel Swan, owns
several pieces. Colonel Swan’s son married the
daughter of General Knox and took the sideboard
with him to General Knox’s home in Thomaston,
Maine, where it remained for many years.</p>

<p>The sideboard is made of oak (showing its English
origin) veneered with mahogany. The lines upon
the front and the figures upon the legs are inlaid
in satinwood, and the knife-box is inlaid in the same
wood. The top of the sideboard is elaborately inlaid
with satinwood and dark mahogany, in wide
bands, separated by lines of ebony and satinwood,
and crossed by fine satinwood lines radiating from
the centre. The handles and escutcheons are of
silver, and the top of the knife-box is covered by a
silver tray with a reticulated railing. The coffee-urn
is of Sheffield plate, and the sideboard with its
appurtenances appears to-day as it did one hundred
years ago in the house of General Knox. It is now
owned by the Hon. James Phinney Baxter of Portland,
Maine.</p>

</div>

<p>Knife-boxes were made of different shapes, to
hold knives, forks, and spoons, and a pair of knife-boxes
was the usual accompaniment to a handsome
sideboard. The most skilled cabinet-makers were
employed in their manufacture, as each curved section
had to be fitted most carefully.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i76">76</a> shows an urn-shaped knife-box of
mahogany inlaid in lines of holly. The interior of
the box is fitted with circular trays
of different heights, and through
the little openings in these trays
the knives and spoons were suspended.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i77">77</a> shows
an urn-shaped knife-box
opened. The top
rests upon a wooden
rod which extends
through the middle of
the box, and instead of
turning back with a
hinge, the top slides up
on this rod, and when
it is raised to a certain
height it releases a spring which holds
the rod firmly in its place. This urn
knife-box is in the Pendleton collection
in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Urn-shaped boxes were designed by
Adam, and are shown in his drawings,
to stand upon pedestals at each end of
the side table, to be used, one for ice-water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and one for hot water, for the butler to
wash the silver, not so plentiful then as now. Very
soon the urn-shaped boxes were utilized to hold
the knives, forks and spoons. Adam, Shearer,
Hepplewhite and Sheraton show designs for knife-boxes,
many of them elaborately carved or inlaid,
but they must have been very costly, and within
the means only of such noblemen, who, in Sheraton’s
words, “are unrestrained with
the thoughts of expensiveness.”</p>

<p>The usual shape of knife-box
found is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i78">78</a>, owned by Mrs. Clarence R.
Hyde, of Brooklyn, N. Y. It is
inlaid both outside and inside and
the handles and fittings are of
silver. The books of designs
show boxes of this shape, with the
lid put back, as in this illustration,
and used to support a large
silver plate.</p>

<p>Mahogany was chiefly used in
sideboards, with inlaying of satinwood,
holly, king, tulip, snake, zebra,
yew, maple, and other woods. Occasionally one
finds a sideboard veneered with walnut. The
curves at the front vary considerably, the ends
being convex, and the centre straight; or the
ends concave, forming with the centre a double
curve. A sideboard with rounded ends and only
four legs was made in large numbers around Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i79">79</a> shows a Hepplewhite sideboard
owned by the writer. It is of mahogany veneered
upon pine, and it was probably the work of a Connecticut
cabinet-maker of about 1790. Six chairs,
made to go with the sideboard, are similarly inlaid,
and the knife-boxes, which have always stood upon
this sideboard, have fine lines of inlaying. There is
one central long drawer, beneath which, slightly
recessed, are doors opening into a cupboard, and
two bottle drawers, each fitted with compartments
to hold four bottles. There is a cupboard at each
curved end, with a drawer above. The coloring of
the wood used in this sideboard is very beautiful.
Each drawer and door is veneered with a bright red
mahogany, with golden markings in the grain, and
this is framed in dark mahogany, outlined in two
lines of satinwood with an ebony line between. The
oval pieces above the legs and the bell-flower design
upon the legs are of satinwood. The combination
of the different shades of mahogany with the light
satinwood is most effective. The handles are new.
When this sideboard came into the possession of
the writer, the old handles had been removed and
large and offensive ones of pressed brass had been
fastened upon every available spot, with that love
for the showy which seizes upon country people
when they attempt the process known as “doing
over.” The lids of the knife-boxes open back with
hinges, and the interior is fitted with a slanting tray,
perforated with openings of different shapes to hold
knives, with the handles up, and spoons with the
bowls up. A fine line of inlaying goes round each
of the openings.</p>

long handle. Another double coaster, somewhat
higher and with reticulated sides, stands beside the
coffee-urn, and two single coasters are in front. All
of these coasters have wooden bottoms, and were
used to hold wine decanters, the double coasters
upon wheels having been designed, so the story goes,
by Washington, for convenience in circulating the
wine around the table.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i80">80</a> shows a Hepplewhite sideboard
with a serpentine front, the doors to the side cupboards
being concave, as well as the space usually
occupied by bottle drawers, while the small cupboard
doors in the middle are convex. A long rounding
drawer extends across the centre and projects beyond
the cupboard below it, while a slide pulls out, forming
a shelf, between the long drawer and the small
cupboard. There are no bottle drawers in this sideboard.
The doors are inlaid with a fan at each
corner, and fine lines of holly are inlaid around the
legs, doors, and drawer. The silver pieces upon the
sideboard top are family heirlooms. The large tea-caddies
at each end are of pewter finely engraved.
This sideboard is owned by Francis H. Bigelow,
Esq., of Cambridge.</p>

<p>A charming little sideboard owned by Mr. Bigelow
is shown in Illustration <a href="#i81">81</a>. The ordinary
measurements of sideboards like the last two shown
are six feet in length, forty inches in height, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
twenty-eight inches in depth. These measures, with
slight variations, give the average size of Hepplewhite
sideboards. Occasionally one finds a small
piece like Illustration <a href="#i81">81</a>, evidently made to fit some
space. This sideboard measures fifty-four inches in
length, thirty-four in height, and twenty-three in

elaborate design.</p>

for the light which the candles would throw

six feet eight inches in length, thirty inches in

shown in Illustration <a href="#i83">83</a>, belonging to Dwight M.
Prouty, Esq., of Boston. It is of mahogany, and is
inlaid with three oval pieces of satinwood, giving
the little piece a very light effect. The legs also
add to that appearance, the reeded upper section
tapering down to a turning and ending in a plain
round foot, which looks almost too small for such a
piece. The outline of the body is curved down to
the legs, making an arch upon the front and sides.</p>

<p>A sideboard of distinctly Sheraton design is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in Illustration <a href="#i84">84</a>. It has the reeded legs which are
the almost unmistakable mark of Sheraton. The
ends of this sideboard are straight, and only the front
is rounding in shape, unlike the sideboard in Illustration
<a href="#i75">75</a>, which forms a complete semicircle.</p>

<p>The wood is of mahogany, inlaid with fine lines of holly.
The little shield-shaped escutcheons at the keyholes
are of ivory. There are three drawers above the
cupboards and two bottle drawers. Upon the top,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

<p>A Sheraton sideboard of later date is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i85">85</a>. It is of mahogany, and was probably
made about 1800. The arched open space in
the middle was left for the cellaret, which was the
usual accompaniment of the sideboard in those days
of hard drinking. The top of this sideboard is surmounted
by drawers, with a back above the drawers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The legs and the columns above them are reeded, and
the little columns at the corners of the upper drawers
are carved, the inner ones with a sheaf of wheat, and
the two outside corners with the acanthus leaf. This
sideboard was formerly owned by Rejoice Newton,
Esq., of Worcester, from whom it has descended to
Waldo Lincoln, Esq., of Worcester.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i86">86</a> shows the latest type of a Sheraton
sideboard, owned by the Colonial Dames of Pennsylvania,
and now in “Stenton,” the house built in
1727 by James Logan, William Penn’s secretary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The sideboard stands where it was placed, about
1805, by George Logan, the great-great grandson of
James. The wood is mahogany, and the large
square knife-boxes were evidently made to fit the
sideboard. The legs, with spade feet, are short,
bringing the body of the sideboard close to the
floor. The handles are brass knobs.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 87.&mdash;Cellarets, 1790.</p>
</div>

<p>Cellarets were made as a part of the dining-room
furniture. They were lined with zinc, to hold the
ice in which the wine bottles were packed to cool,
and at the lower edge of the body of the cellaret was
a faucet, or some arrangement by which the water
from the melted ice could be drawn off. They were
designed by Chippendale and all of his contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and by the later cabinet-makers,&mdash;Adam,
Hepplewhite, and Sheraton.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i87">87</a> shows two cellarets of different
styles. The cellaret of octagonal shape, brass bound,
with straight legs, is of the style most commonly
found. It is in the Poore collection, at Indian Hill.
Cellarets of this shape figure in books of designs
from 1760 to 1800. The other is oval in form, and
has the leg usually attributed to the Adam brothers.
This cellaret belongs to Francis H. Bigelow, Esq.,
of Cambridge. Both cellarets are of mahogany.</p>

<p>We now come to sideboards of the type called
“Colonial”; why, it would be difficult to trace,
since sideboards of this heavy design were not made
until over twenty-five years after the time that the
United States took the place of the American
colonies.</p>

<p>The heavy Empire fashions gained such popularity
in the early years of the nineteenth century that
furniture made after those fashions entirely superseded
the graceful slender-legged styles of Shearer,
Hepplewhite, and Sheraton, and sideboards were made
as heavy and clumsy as the others had been light
and graceful. The cupboards were extended nearly
to the floor, from which the sideboard was lifted by
balls or by large carved bears’ feet. Round pillars,
veneered, or carved similar to bedposts of the
period, with a twist, or the pineapple and acanthus
leaf, were used upon the front, and small drawers
were added to the top. At about this time glass
handles came into fashion, and many of these heavy
sideboards have knobs of glass, either clear or opalescent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The brass handles that were used were
either the rosette and ring or the knob shape.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i88">88</a> shows a sideboard of this period,
1810-1820, made of mahogany; the panels to the
doors, the veneered pillars, and the piece at the
back of the top being of a lighter and more finely
marked mahogany than the rest, which is quite dark.
There is a little panel inlaid in colors upon the lower
rail in the centre. The handles are the rosette and
ring, the smaller handles matching the large ones.
This sideboard belonged to the late Colonel DeWitt
of Oxford, Massachusetts, and it is now owned by
W. S. G. Kennedy, Esq., of Worcester.</p>

<p>Another type of mahogany Empire sideboard,
and one often seen, is shown in Illustration <a href="#i89">89</a>. It
is owned by L. J. Shapiro, Esq., of Norfolk, Virginia.
The body of the sideboard is raised from the floor
by very handsome bears’ feet, and the posts extending
up to the drawers are carved, and topped by
typical Empire carvings of wing effect, which separate
the drawers. The centre section of doors is
curved outward slightly, and there is a band of
carving across the lower edge, below the doors.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century
the temperance question did not enter the heads of
the fine gentlemen of the day, and the serving of
wine was an important consideration. The cellaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
or wine cooler accompanied the sideboard, which in
the drawings of Hepplewhite, Shearer, and Sheraton
had bottle drawers.</p>

<p>What Shearer called “a gentleman’s
social table” was designed by several, with
conveniences for bottles, glasses, and biscuit, and
for facilitating the progress of the wine around
the table. In this country the mixing of punch or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
other beverages was furthered by a piece of furniture
called a mixing table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Charles Custis Harrison, of St. David’s, Pennsylvania,
owns the mixing table in Illustration <a href="#i90">90</a>,
and a sideboard to match it. Both pieces were inherited
from Robert Morris, in whose famous mansion
in Philadelphia
they stood. The
wood of the table
is mahogany
and the drawers
and doors are of
satinwood, finely
inlaid. There is a
well in the top for
a bowl, in which
was brewed
the punch of
the Philadelphia
forefathers. The
cover of the table
is hinged, and
the four shelves
which show in
the illustration fold flat when the cover is down.</p>

<p>The table in Illustration <a href="#i91">91</a> belongs to the Misses
Garrett of Williamsburg, Virginia, and is known as
a “mint julep” table, having been made for the concocting
of that Southern beverage by a Baltimore
cabinet-maker. There are shelves behind the door
for the accessories to the julep, and for the mixing
of it the top of the table is marble.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">FROM 1644 to
about 1670 desks
appear in colonial
inventories. During
those years the word
“desk” meant a box,
which was often made
with a sloping lid for
convenience in writing,
or to rest a book upon
in reading. This box
was also used to hold
writing-materials and papers
or books, and was
sometimes called a Bible-box,
from the fact that
the Bible was kept in it. Illustration <a href="#i92">92</a> shows
two of these desks from the collection of Charles
R. Waters, Esq., of Salem. The larger desk is
twenty inches in length and thirteen and one-half
in height, and formerly had a narrow shelf in the
inside across the back. The front is carved with
the initials A. W. and the date 1654. The smaller
desk measures thirteen and one-half inches in length
and eight in height.</p>

<p>The next style of desk made its appearance in the
inventories of about 1660, under a name with French
derivation: “scrutoir,” “scriptor,” “scrittore,” “scrutor,”
“scriptoire,”
down to the phonetically
spelled “screwtor.”
About 1720
the word “bureau,”
also from the French,
came into use in combination
with the word “desk,” or “table.” It has
continued to be employed up to the present time,
for the slant-top desk is even now, in country towns,
called a bureau-desk. As the word “desk” seems
to have been more or less in use through these early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
years, while for the last hundred years it has been
almost entirely employed, alone or in combination
with other words, I have designated as desks all
pieces of furniture made for use in writing.</p>

<p>A cabinet and writing desk used by perhaps all
of the Dutch Patroons, of Albany, is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i94">94</a>. It has stood in the same house, Cherry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Hill, Albany, since 1768, when the house was built by
Philip Van Rensselaer, the ancestor of the present

     <p class="cf">Illus. 95.&mdash;Desk, about 1680.</p>

<p>It was probably
brought from Holland by Killian Van Rensselaer,
and in it were kept the accounts of the manor. The
desk is open in Illustration <a href="#i95">95</a>, showing the compartments
for papers and books. The wood of this splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
piece is oak, beautifully panelled and carved, and
the fine panel seen when the desk is closed forms,

<p>Illustration <a href="#i96">96</a> shows a desk owned by Miss
Gage, of Worcester, of rather rude construction, and
apparently not made by a skilled cabinet-maker. It
has two long drawers with two short drawers above
them. The space above these two short drawers is
reached from an opening or well with a slide, directly
in front of the small drawers of the interior, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
may be seen in the illustration. The pillars at each
side of the middle compartment pull out as drawers.
The handles are new, and should be drop handles,
or early stamped ones. The characteristics which
determine the date of this desk are the single moulding
around the drawers, the two short drawers, and
the well opening with a slide. The bracket feet
would indicate a few years’ later date than that of
similar pieces with ball feet.</p>

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth century
slant-top desks appeared with a bookcase or cabinet
top. The lower or desk part was made usually with
a moulding around the top, into which the upper
part was set. The doors were of panelled wood or
had looking-glasses set in them, but occasionally they
were of glass.</p>

<p>The frontispiece shows an extraordinary piece of
furniture owned by Samuel Verplanck, Esq., of Fishkill,
New York. It has belonged in the family of
Mr. Verplanck since 1753, when it was bought by
an ancestor, Governor James de Lancey, at an auction
sale of the effects of Sir Danvers Osborne, who
was governor of the Province of New York for the
space of five days, as he landed at Whitehall Slip,
New York, from the good ship <i>Arundel</i> on Friday,
and the following Wednesday he committed suicide.
Sir Danvers had brought his household goods with
him upon the <i>Arundel</i>, and among them was this
secretary.</p>

<p>Lacquered furniture was fashionable during the
first quarter of the eighteenth century, and while the
first lacquered pieces came through Holland, by 1712<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
“Japan work” was so popular, even in the American
colonies, that an advertisement of Mr. Nehemiah
Partridge appeared in a Boston paper of that year,
that he would do “all sorts of Japan work.”</p>

<p>The wood of this secretary is oak, and the entire
piece is covered with lacquer in brilliant red, blue,
and gold. The upper part, or cabinet, has doors
which are lacquered on the inside, with looking-glasses
on the outside. A looking-glass is also set
into the middle of the top. These glasses are all
the original ones and are of heavy plate with the old
bevel upon the edges. Above the compartments,
and fitting into the two arches of the top are semi-circular-shaped
flap doors, which open downward.
Between these and the pigeonholes are two shallow
drawers extending across the cabinet. The middle
compartment has two doors with vases of flowers
lacquered upon them, and there is a drawer above,
while the spaces each side of the doors are occupied
by drawers. The slides for candlesticks are gone,
but the slits show where they were originally. The
lower or desk part is divided by a moulding which
runs around it above the three lower drawers, and
the space between this and the writing-table is taken
by two short drawers, but it has no well with a slide
like the desk in Illustration <a href="#i96">96</a>. The arrangement
of the small drawers and compartments is the same
as in the desk in Illustration <a href="#i96">96</a>, and the lacquered
pillars form the fronts of drawers which pull out,
each side of the middle compartment, which has
upon its door a jaunty little gentleman in European
costume of the period. The moulding upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
frame around the drawers and the two short upper
drawers would place the date of this piece early in
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The first thought upon
seeing the feet of the desk, is that they were originally
brackets which were sawed off and the large
ball feet added,
but it must have
been made originally
as it now
stands, for both
the brackets and
the balls under
them are lacquered
with the
old “Japan work”
like the rest of
the secretary.</p>

<p>A style of desk
of a somewhat
later date is occasionally
found,
generally made of
maple. Its form
and proportions
are similar to
those of a low-boy
with the Dutch bandy-leg and foot, and a desk top,
the slanting lid of which lets down for use in writing.
The top sets into a moulding around the edge of
the lower part, in the same manner as the top part
of a high-boy is set upon its base. Illustration <a href="#i97">97</a>
shows a desk of this style in the building of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Pennsylvania Historical Society, labelled as having
belonged to William Penn, but which is of a later
date than that would imply, as it was made from
1720 to 1730, while Penn left this country in 1701,
never to return to it.</p>

<p>The mahogany desk shown in Illustration <a href="#i98">98</a>
belongs to Walter Hosmer, Esq., and is a most
graceful and charming
little piece, intended
probably for a lady’s
use. It measures
twenty-four and a
half inches in length
and forty-one and a
half inches in height.
There are three square
drawers in the lower
part, and the upper
part has two small
square drawers for
pens, with a third
between them. The
two pen drawers pull
out and support the
lid when lowered.
The interior of the
desk has eighteen small drawers, shaped and placed
so that their fronts form a curve, and each little
drawer at the top is carved with the rising sun, or
fan, like the middle drawer in the lower part. The
entire design of the interior is like that in a large
block-front desk now owned by George S. Palmer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

Dunham in 1769, and it is possible that the two

<p>Another desk belonging to Mr. Hosmer is shown
in Illustration <a href="#i99">99</a>. The bandy-legs end in a claw-and-ball
of a flattened shape, and instead of the
drawer, plain or
with a carved sunburst,
usually seen
between the side
drawers of the lower
part, the wood of
the frame is sawed
in a simple design.
The upper part
has three drawers,
and the lid when
down rests upon
two slides which
pull out for the
purpose. The interior
is quite simple,
having four
drawers with eight small compartments above. This

inches and a half in height.</p>

wood. The lid of the desk is blocked like the
front, and like the lid of the desk in Illustration <a href="#i109">109</a>,
requiring for the blocked lid and drawer fronts wood
from two to three inches thick, as each front is
carved from one thick plank.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i102">102</a> shows a block-front mahogany
desk, owned by Francis H. Bigelow, Esq., of
Cambridge. It formerly belonged to Dr. John
Snelling Popkin, who was Professor of Greek at
Harvard University from 1826 to 1833, and probably
descended to him, as it was made about 1770.
The legs, with claw-and-ball feet, are blocked like
the drawers, as was usual in block-front pieces, another
feature of which is the moulding upon the
frame around the drawers.</p>

<p>In all the desks shown, the pillars at each side of
the middle door in the interior pull out as drawers.
These were supposed to be secret drawers. Often
the little arched pieces above the pigeonholes are
drawer fronts. The middle compartment is sometimes
a drawer, or if it has a door, behind this door
is a drawer which, when taken entirely out, proves
to have a secret drawer opening from its back.
Occasionally an opening to a secret compartment is
found in the back of the desk. All these were designed
at a time when banks and deposit companies
did not abound, and the compartments were doubtless
utilized to hold papers and securities of value.
There are traditions of wills being discovered in these
secret compartments, and novelists have found them
of great convenience in the construction of plots.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary in Illustration <a href="#i103">103</a> is an extraordinarily
fine piece. It is of mahogany, and tradition
says that it was brought from Holland, but it is distinctly
a Chippendale piece, from the fine carving
upon the feet and above the doors, and from the
reeded pilasters with exquisitely carved capitals.
There are five of these pilasters,&mdash;three in front and
one upon each side, at the back. The doors hold
looking-glasses, the shape of which, straight at the
bottom and in curves at the top, is that of the early
looking-glasses. The two semicircular, concave
spaces in the interior above the cabinet are lacquered
in black and gold.</p>

<p>The middle compartment in the desk, between the
pigeonholes, has a door, behind which is a large
drawer. When this drawer is pulled entirely out,
at its back may be seen small drawers, and upon
taking out one of these and pressing a spring, secret
compartments are disclosed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Holmes, in “The Professor at the Breakfast
Table,” has written of this secretary thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“At the house of a friend where I once passed a
night, was one of those stately, upright cabinet desks
and cases of drawers which were not rare in prosperous
families during the past century [<i>i.e.</i> the eighteenth].
It had held the clothes and the books
and papers of generation after generation. The
hands that opened its drawers had grown withered,
shrivelled, and at last had been folded in death.
The children that played with the lower handles had
got tall enough to open the desk,&mdash;to reach the
upper shelves behind the folding doors,&mdash;grown
bent after a while,&mdash;and followed those who had
gone before, and left the old cabinet to be ransacked
by a new generation.</p>

<p>“A boy of twelve was looking at it a few years
ago, and, being a quick-witted fellow, saw that all
the space was not accounted for by the smaller
drawers in the part beneath the lid of the desk.
Prying about with busy eyes and fingers, he at
length came upon a spring, on pressing which, a
secret drawer flew from its hiding-place. It had
never been opened but by the maker. The mahogany
shavings and dust were lying in it, as when the
artisan closed it, and when I saw it, it was as fresh as
if that day finished.</p>

<p>“Is there not one little drawer in your soul, my
sweet reader, which no hand but yours has ever
opened, and which none that have known you
seemed to have suspected? What does it hold?
A sin? I hope not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The “quick-witted boy, with busy eyes and fingers,”
was the present owner of the secretary, the
Rev. William R. Huntington, D.D., of Grace
Church, New York, and since Dr. Holmes wrote of
the secretary, new generations have grown up to
reach the handles of the drawers and to ransack the
old cabinet.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 104.&mdash;Block-front Desk, about 1770.</p>
</div>

<p>The middle ornament upon the top was gone
many years ago, but Dr. Huntington remembers,
as a boy with his brother, playing with the two end
figures which, it is not astonishing to relate, have
not been seen since those years. The figures were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
carved from wood, of men at work at their trade of
cabinet-making, and the boys who were given the
carved figures for toys played that the little workmen
were the ones who made the secretary. The
great handles upon the sides are large and heavy
enough for the purpose for which they were intended,
to lift the massive piece of furniture.</p>

<p>The block-front mahogany desk in Illustration
<a href="#i81">81</a> shows the blocked slanting lid. The brasses are
original and are unusually large and fine. This
desk belongs to Dwight Blaney, Esq., of Boston.</p>

<p>A splendid mahogany secretary owned by Albert
S. Rines, Esq., of Portland, Maine, is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i105">105</a>. The lower part is bombé or
kettle-shaped, but the drawers, which swell with
the shape in front, do not extend to the corners,
like the kettle-shaped bureau in Illustration <a href="#i30">30</a>,
but leave a vacant space in the interior, not taken
up at the ends. Three beautiful, flat, reeded
columns with Corinthian capitals are upon the
doors, which still hold the old bevelled looking-glasses.
The handles are original, but are not as
large as one usually finds upon such a secretary.
There are larger handles upon the sides, as was
the custom. The cabinet in the upper part is very
similar to the one in Illustration <a href="#i103">103</a>, but there is
no lacquering upon the curved tops behind the
doors. With the thoroughness of workmanship and
dislike of sham which characterized the cabinet-makers
of the eighteenth century, there are fine
pieces of mahogany inside at the back of the looking-glasses.
The cabinet in the desk proper, which
is covered by the slanting lid when closed, is unusually
good, with the curved drawers, set also in
a curve.</p>

<p>This secretary is generous in secret compartments,
of which there are six. The centre panel
of the cabinet is the front of a drawer, locked by a
concealed spring, and at the back of this drawer are
two secret drawers; beneath it, by sliding a thin
piece of mahogany, another drawer is disclosed;
a fourth is at the top, behind a small drawer, and at
each end of the curved drawers is a secret drawer.
The secretary is over eight feet in height.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i106">106</a> shows a beautiful little piece of
furniture, modelled after what Chippendale calls a
writing-table or a bureau table, by the latter term
meaning a bureau desk with a flat top. The same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
unusually fine shells are carved upon this as upon
the double chest of drawers in Illustration <a href="#i21">21</a>, and
upon the low chest of
drawers in Illustration
<a href="#i31">31</a>.</p>

<p>In the inside of
one of the drawers of
this writing-table is
written in a quaint old
hand a name which is
illegible, and “Newport,
R.I., 176-,” the
final figure of the date
not being sufficiently
plain to determine it.
Desks, secretaries, and
chests of drawers have
been found with block
fronts and these fine
shells. All were originally
owned in Rhode
Island or near there,
and nearly all can be
traced back to Newport,
probably to the
same cabinet-maker.
This writing-table was
bought in 1901 from
the heirs of Miss Rebecca
Shaw of Wickford,
Rhode Island. Miss Shaw died in 1900 at
over ninety years of age. The writing-table is now
owned by Harry Harkness Flagler, Esq., of Millbrook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
New York. It measures thirty-four inches
in height and thirty-six and three-quarters inches in
length. A door with a shell carved upon it opens
into a recessed cupboard. A writing-table like this
is in the Pendleton collection, also found in Rhode
Island.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i107">107</a> shows a desk with cabinet top and
serpentine or ox-bow front. It is made of English
walnut of a fine golden hue which has never been
stained or darkened. The doors are of panelled
wood, with fluted columns at each side. It was
owned in the Bannister family of Newburyport until
1870, when it was given to the Newburyport
Library. It now stands in the old Prince mansion,
occupied by the Library.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i108">108</a> shows a mahogany desk with serpentine
front and claw-and-ball feet, owned by Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle, of Brooklyn. The serpentine
drawers of this piece and the one preceding are
carved from a solid block, not quite so thick as is
necessary for the block-front drawers. This desk
was made at about the same time as the secretary in
the last illustration.</p>

<p>The bill of lading in Illustration <a href="#i109">109</a> is preserved
in the house known as the “Warner House,” in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, built by Archibald
Macphaedris, a member of the King’s Council. It
was commenced in 1712, and occupied in 1716, but
not finished until 1718. Mr. Macphaedris died in
1729, and his widow, upon her second marriage,
gave the house to her daughter, married then to
Colonel Jonathan Warner, and the house has remained
ever since in the possession of their descendants.</p>

<p>The rooms are panelled, and are filled with the
furniture bought by successive generations. Upon
the walls hang Copley portraits of Colonel Warner
and his wife and her haughty mother, Mrs. Macphaedris
(who was a daughter of Lieutenant-Governor
Wentworth), and of Colonel Warner’s young
daughter Mary, in her straight little stays, which
are still preserved, along with the garments, stiff
with gold embroideries, which Colonel Warner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his wife wore upon state occasions. A number of
the illustrations for this book were taken in the
Warner house, which is one of the best-preserved
old houses in the country, and which, with its furnishings
and decorations, presents an unusually good
picture of the home of the wealthy colonist.</p>

<p>The quaint wording of this bill of lading, and the
list of furniture mentioned, make it interesting in
this connection, but none of the pieces of that date
remain in the house, which was evidently refurnished
with great elegance, after 1760, when the old furniture
was probably discarded as “old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i110">110</a> shows a bookcase built into the
Warner house. It is made of mahogany, and stands
in every particular exactly as it was originally made.
The bill of lading of 1716, shown in Illustration <a href="#i85">85</a>,
mentions a bookcase, but this bookcase is of later
date, and was probably bought by Colonel Warner
for his daughter, as the books in the case are all
bound alike in a golden brown leather, with gilt
tooling, and each book has “Miss. Warner” stamped
in gilt letters upon the cover. The books are the
standard works of that time,&mdash;Shakespeare, Milton,
Spenser, “The Spectator,” Fox’s “Book of Martyrs,”
and all the books which a wealthy man of those days
would buy to furnish a library. The dates of the
editions vary from 1750 to 1765, so the latter date
may be given to this bookcase. It was once entirely
filled with “Miss. Warner’s” books, but early in
the nineteenth century, during a great fire in Portsmouth,
the books were removed for safety, and all
were not brought back.</p>

<p>At the top of the bookcase is a row of Chinese
fretwork, which, together with the massive handles,
would also place its date about 1765. The case is
divided into three sections, the sides of the lower
part being devoted to drawers. The lower middle
section has four drawers, above which is a wide flap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which lets
down, disclosing
a
desk with
drawers
and pigeonholes.</p>

<p>A bookcase
owned
by J.J. Gilbert,
Esq.,
of Baltimore,
is shown in
Illustration
<a href="#i111">111</a>. It is
made after
Chippendale
designs,
and
is richly
carved.
The base
and feet are
very elaborate,
and
the cornice
and pediment,
are
wonderfully
fine. The broken
arch has delicate sprays of carved wood, projecting
beyond the edge, and laid over the open fretwork, and
the crowning ornament in the centre is a carved urn
with a large spray of flowers. The ornaments and
mouldings separating the sections of glass in the
doors are as fine as the other rich carving upon this
bookcase.</p>

<p>A wonderful Hepplewhite bookcase is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i112">112</a>. It is owned by George W. Holmes,
Esq., of Charleston, South Carolina, and carries with it
an impression of the wealth and luxury in Charleston,
before the Civil War and the other disasters that
befell that city in the latter half of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>This bookcase is nearly nine feet in length, and
is made of unusually fine mahogany. The lower
part is designed in a series of curves which prevents
the plain look that a straight front would give in
such length. The doors form one curve and a part
of the other two, which are completed by the drawers
at each side; a skilful management of a long space.
The curves at the top of the pediment follow the
same lines, and the bookcase was evidently designed
by a master hand. It was probably brought from
England, together with a secretary to match it.
Above the doors and drawers, shelves pull out, on
which to rest books. A fine line of holly runs around
each door and drawer, with a star inlaid at the corners
of the doors, while a very beautiful design is inlaid
in light and dark woods, in the space on the pediment,
which is finished with the broken arch, of the high,
slender type, with carved rosettes. The centre ornament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
between the rosettes, is a basket of flowers
carved in wood.</p>

<p>After the publication of the designs of Shearer,
Hepplewhite, and Sheraton, the heavy desks were
superseded by those of lighter design, and the slant-top
bureau desk was seldom made after 1790.
Sheraton says: “Bureau in France is a small chest
of drawers. It has generally been applied to common
desks with drawers made under them. These
pieces of furniture are nearly obsolete in London.”
Slant-top desks do not appear in cabinet-makers’
books published after 1800, and it is safe to assign
a date previous to the nineteenth century to any
such desk.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i113">113</a> shows the latest type of a slant-top
desk, made in 1790-1795. The frame is of
maple, the drawers being of curly maple edged with
ebony. The lid is of curly maple framed in bird’s-eye
maple with ebony lines, and in the centre is a
star made of mahogany and ebony. The small
drawers inside are of bird’s-eye maple, three of the
drawers having an ebony and mahogany star. The
base is what Hepplewhite calls a French base, and
the desk, which measures only thirty-six inches in
length, is a good example of the artistic use of the
different varieties of maple with their golden hues.
This desk belongs to the writer.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i114">114</a> shows a Hepplewhite desk with
cabinet top owned by the writer, and made about
1790. The drawers are veneered with satinwood,
with a row of fine inlaying of holly and ebony around
each drawer front. The base is after Hepplewhite’s
design, and has a row of ebony and holly inlaying
across it. The slightly slanting lid turns back and
rests upon two pulls to form a writing-table. The
pigeonholes and small drawers are behind the glass
doors, which are made like two Gothic arches, with
three little pillars, and panels of satinwood between
the bases of the pillars. The pediment at the top
of the cabinet is quite characteristic of the period.</p>

about 1800.</p>
</div>

<p>The word
“tambour” is
thus defined by
Sheraton: “Tambour
tables among
cabinet-makers
are of two sorts;
one for a lady or
gentleman to
write at, and another
for the former
to execute
needlework by.
The Writing
Tambour Tables
are almost out of
use at present,
being both insecure
and liable to
injury. They are
called Tambour
from the cylindrical
forms of their
tops, which are
glued up in narrow
strips of mahogany
and laid
upon canvas,
which binds them together, and suffers them at the
same time to yield to the motion that their ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
make in the curved groove in which they run.
Tambour tables are often introduced in small pieces
where no strength or security is desired.”</p>

<p>In his will, George Washington left to Dr. Craik
“my beaureau (or as cabinet-makers call it, tambour
secretary).” Illustration <a href="#i116">116</a> shows what might be
called a tambour secretary. It is made of mahogany

<p>Illustration <a href="#i117">117</a> shows
a small Sheraton writing
table for a lady’s
use, also owned by Mr.
Bigelow. It is of simple
construction, having
one drawer, and when
the desk is closed, the effect is that of a small table
with a flat top.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i118">118</a> shows a desk which was copied
from one of Sheraton’s designs, published in 1793,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and described as “a lady’s cabinet and writing table.”
The legs in Sheraton’s drawing are slender and
straight, while these are twisted and carved, and the
space, which in the design is left open for books, in
this desk is closed with a tambour door.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">CHAIRS are
seldom mentioned
in the
earliest colonial
inventories, and
few were in use in
either England or
America at that time.
Forms and stools were
used for seats in the
sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries,
and inventories of that
period, even those of
wealthy men, do not
often contain more
than one or two chairs.
The chair was the seat of honor given to the guest,
others sitting upon forms and stools. This custom
was followed by the American colonists, and forms
or benches and joint or joined stools constituted
the common seats during the first part of the seventeenth
century.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 120.&mdash;Turned Chair,<br /> Sixteenth
Century.</p>
</div>

<p>The chairs in use during that period were
“thrown” or turned
chairs; wainscot
chairs, sometimes described
as “scrowled”
or carved chairs; and
later, chairs covered
with leather, or
“Turkey work,”
and other fabrics.</p>

<p>The best-known
turned chair in this
country is the “President’s
Chair” at
Harvard University.
Dr. Holmes has
written of it in
“Parson Turell’s
Legacy”:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">“&mdash;a chair of oak,&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp6">Funny old chair, with seat like wedge,<br />
Sharp behind and broad front edge,&mdash;<br />
One of the oddest of human things,<br />

<p class="p1">In the Bolles collection is a chair similar to the
Harvard chair, and one is shown in Illustration <a href="#i120">120</a>,
owned by Henry F. Waters, Esq., of Salem. A
turned chair of the same period with a square seat
is owned by the Connecticut Historical Society.</p>

<p>Provision was made for the youngest of the large
family of children, with which the colonist was usually
blessed, in the high chair, which is found in
almost every type. A turned high chair is shown
in Illustration <a href="#i121">121</a>, brought by Richard Mather to
America in 1635, and used to hold the successive
babies of that famous family,&mdash;Samuel, Increase,
Cotton, and the others. The rod is missing which
was fastened across the front to hold the child in,
and only the holes show where the pegs were placed
to support the foot-rest. This quaint little chair is
owned by the American Antiquarian Society of
Worcester.</p>

<p>A style of turned chair
more commonly in use is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i122">122</a>, said
to have been brought on
the <i>Mayflower</i> by Governor
Carver. The chair in Illustration
<a href="#i122">123</a>, originally owned
by Elder Brewster, is of a
rarer type, the spindles being
greater in number and
more finely turned. Both of
these chairs are in Pilgrim
Hall, in Plymouth. Turned
chairs are not infrequently
found of the type of Illustration
<a href="#i122">122</a>, but rarely like
the Brewster chair or the
turned chair in Illustration
<a href="#i120">120</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The wainscot chair was made entirely of wood, usually
oak, with a panelled back, from which came the
name “wainscot.” Its valuation in inventories was two
or three times that of the turned chair, which is probably
the reason why wainscot chairs are seldom found.</p>

<p>The finest wainscot chair in this country is shown
in Illustration <a href="#i124">124</a>. It belongs to the Essex Institute
of Salem, having been given to that society in
1821 by a descendant of the original owner, Sarah
Dennis of Ipswich, who possessed two of these
chairs; the other is now the President’s chair at
Bowdoin College.</p>

<p>A plainer form of the wainscot chair is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i125">125</a>. It was brought to Newbury in the
ship <i>Hector</i>, in 1633, and is now in the collection of
the late Major Ben:
Perley Poore, at Indian
Hill.</p>

<p>By the middle of
the seventeenth century
chairs had become
more common,
and inventories of that
period had frequent
mention of leather or
leather-backed chairs.
Some of the earliest
leather chairs have the
under part of the frame
similar to that of the
wainscot chair, with
plain legs and stretchers,
while others have
the legs and back
posts turned. Illustration
<a href="#i126">126</a> shows a
leather chair made
about 1660, in the Waters collection. The seat and
back have been covered with leather in the same
manner as they were originally, as enough remained
of the old cover to copy.</p>

<p>A chair of some later date, about 1680, is shown
in Illustration <a href="#i126">127</a>, also from the Waters collection,
the back and seat of which were originally of Turkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
work. The frame is similar to that in Illustration
<a href="#i126">126</a>, with the exception of the carved brace across
the front, which feature leads one to give the chair a
later date than the one in Illustration <a href="#i126">126</a>. The
feet have been sawed off.</p>

<p>Other coverings beside
Turkey work were
used,&mdash;velvet, camlett,
plush, or cloth,
as well as an occasional
cover “wrought
by hir owne hand.”
Until the latter
part of the seventeenth
century a
somewhat architectural
style prevailed in
chairs, settles, and
tables. This was succeeded
by the graceful
lines and carving
of the cane furniture
which came into fashion
during the last
quarter of that century.
It is called
Jacobean furniture,
although that name
would not seem to
be strictly accurate, for the Jacobean period was
ended before cane furniture was introduced into
England, about 1678. The cane chairs form a
complete contrast to the heavy wainscot or turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
chairs in use previously, the light effect coming not
only from the cane seat and back, but also from the
frame, which was usually carved in a graceful design.</p>

<p>A chair of similar effect, but
with turned legs, and carved
in a different design, with the
crown as the central figure of
the underbrace and top, is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i129">129</a>.
It belongs to Miss Mary
Coates of Philadelphia, to
whom it has descended
from Josiah Langdale, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
whose inventory this chair, with its mates, was mentioned.
Josiah Langdale took ship with his family
and belongings, from England for America, in 1723.</p>

<p>Before sailing he
became very ill and
prayed that he might
die and be buried in
the old graveyard,
but his wish was not
granted, and he was
carried on board,
taking his coffin
with him. Three
days out (but not
far from land) he
died, and was buried
in his coffin, at sea.
The coffin was not
sufficiently weighted,
however, and it
drifted back to land,
where it was opened,
and its occupant
identified, and
Josiah Langdale was
buried from the old
Quaker meeting-house,
as he had
prayed. His widow
came safely to America
with her furniture, among which was this chair.</p>

<p>Both Flemish and Spanish characteristics appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in the chair in Illustration <a href="#i130">130</a>. The front legs
are in the Flemish style, the scroll foot turning back
as it often does. The twisted stretchers and back
posts show the influence of Spanish or Portuguese
fashions. This chair is in the Poore collection at
Indian Hill, Newburyport.</p>

<p>It will be noticed
that, instead of being twisted, the upper part of the
front legs is turned in balls to provide a stronger
hold for the pegs which support the foot-rest.
There are four holes for these pegs, at different
heights, in order that the rest might be lowered as
the infantile legs lengthened. The crown appears
in the top of the high chair, while the arm-chair has
a child’s figure carved in the centre of the top. The
arms of both chairs are carved with the acanthus leaf.</p>

<p>An example of the finest carving attained in cane
furniture is shown in Illustration <a href="#i132">132</a>. This exquisite
chair is owned by Harry Harkness Flagler, Esq.,
of Millbrook. The design of the top is repeated
in the front brace, but much enlarged. The frame
of the seat and the arms are carved like those in
Illustration <a href="#i131">131</a>. The legs end in a curious form of
the Spanish foot.</p>

<p>The popularity of the cane chair, as well as its
strength, is attested by the number which have survived
the centuries, in fair condition for chairs
so light in appearance.</p>

<p>The cane chair in Illustration <a href="#i133">133</a> is owned by
Dwight M. Prouty, Esq., of Boston. The top of the
under brace is carved in a crescent-shaped design,
which is used again in the top rail. The front leg is a
Flemish scroll with a ball beneath it. The cane back
is unusual in design, the carved wood on each side
making a diamond-shaped effect.</p>

<p>The chair in Illustration <a href="#i133">134</a> belongs to the writer.
The cane extends up into the curve made in the
top rail of the back, which is, like the underbrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and the sides of the back, more elaborately carved
than the chairs in Illustrations <a href="#i128">128</a> and <a href="#i129">129</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The most common chair during the first half
of the eighteenth century was the “slat back,” with
a rush seat. The number of slats varied; three,
four, and five slats being used. The slats were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
made in different designs, those made in Pennsylvania
being curved.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 144.&mdash;Five-slat Chair,<br />about 1750.</p>
</div>

<p>Two slat-back chairs are shown in Illustration <a href="#i143">143</a>
from the Whipple house in Ipswich. The large
chair was found in
the country, stuffed
and covered with
many layers of wadding
and various
materials. When
they were removed,
this frame was disclosed,
but the tops
of the posts had
been sawed off.
The back posts
should terminate in
a turned knob, like
the Carver chair in
Illustration <a href="#i122">122</a>,
which this chair
strongly resembles,
the slats taking the
place of the turned
spindles of the Carver
chair. The
small chair is probably
of later date,
and was evidently
intended for a
child’s use. Chairs with three-slat backs are in
Illustrations <a href="#i54">54</a> and <a href="#i201">201</a>.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i144">144</a> shows a five-slat or five-back chair
owned by the writer. It was made about 1750, and
the rockers were probably added twenty-five or
thirty years later. They project
as far in front as in the
back, which is evidence of
their age. Later rockers were
made longer, probably for
safety, the short rocker at
the back proving dangerous
to the equilibrium of a too
vigorous occupant
of the rocking
chair. This
chair has never
been restored and
is a very good
example of the
slat-back chair.
It is painted
black with lines
of yellow.</p>

ones, made to fit the back, with a deeper
curve than some, and, as may be seen by comparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
them with others illustrated, with a more decided

</div>

<p>The type of chair succeeding the slat-back in
popularity was the Windsor, which was made for
years in large numbers both in England and
America.</p>

<p>Windsor chairs made their first appearance in
this country about 1730, in Philadelphia, and “Philadelphia
made” Windsor chairs soon became very
popular. Advertisements of them abound in newspapers
up to 1800, and they may be found with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
slat-back chairs in almost any country house,
frequently upon the piazza, whence many a one
has been bought by the keen-eyed collector
driving along the road. The original Philadelphia
fashion was to paint the chairs green, but after
they were made all over the country they were
probably painted to suit the taste of the buyer.</p>

<p>There is a story
that the name Windsor
was derived from
the English town,
where one of the royal
Georges found in a
shepherd’s cottage a
chair of this style,
which he bought and
had others made from,&mdash;thereby
setting the
fashion.</p>

<p>Windsor chairs are
found in several styles,
two of which are shown
in Illustration <a href="#i146">146</a>,
owned by the writer.
Side-chairs like the
arm-chair were made with the dividing strip which
connects the arms left out, and the rounding top rail
continuing down to the seat. The other chair in
the illustration is known as a “fan back” from its
shape with the flaring top.</p>

<p>The Dutch chair with bandy or cabriole legs and
a splat in the back made its appearance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
early years of the eighteenth century, and was the
forerunner of the Chippendale chair. The first
Dutch chairs have a back similar in form to the
Queen Anne chair in Illustration <a href="#i108">108</a>, slightly higher
and narrower than later backs. They are sometimes
called Queen Anne chairs, and sometimes
parrot-back, from the shape of the opening each

of earlier chairs are retained in the first
Dutch chairs, one of which is shown in Illustration

tassels carved at the top. These chairs were made
about 1740-1750. The backs of the last four

curving down into the side-posts with rounded
ends, with the effect of back and sides being in one

<p>Easy-chairs formed a part of the bedroom furniture

they were made in various styles, with Dutch, Chippendale,
and Hepplewhite legs. Hepplewhite gives

and also a “saddle-check chair,” while upon the same

required to stuff and cover the chair, the reason
for the high valuation is understood. In the days
when the fireplace gave what heat there was in the
room, these great chairs must have been most comfortable,
with the high back and sides to keep out
draughts.</p>

<p>We now come to
the most important
period in the consideration
of chairs,&mdash;the
last half of the
eighteenth century. During this period many books
of designs were published, which probably came to
this country within a year or two of their publication,
and which afforded American cabinet-makers an
opportunity for copying the best English examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Chippendale’s designs were published in 1753,
Hepplewhite’s in 1789, Sheraton’s in 1791. Besides
these three chief chair-makers, there were Ince
and Mayhew, 1765; Robert Manwaring, 1765; R.
and J. Adam, 1773; and others of less note.</p>

<p>Chippendale drew most of his ideas from the
French, notably in the way of ornamentation, but
the form of his chairs was developed chiefly from
the Dutch style, with the bandy leg and splat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
back. His straight-legged chairs were suggested by
the Chinese furniture, which was fashionable about
the middle of the eighteenth century. These various
styles Chippendale adapted, and employed with
such success that his was the strongest influence of
the century upon furniture, and for a period of over
thirty years it was supreme.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century it
was fashionable to decorate houses and gardens in
“Chinese taste,” and furniture was designed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
“Chinese temples” by various cabinet-makers.
That the American colonies followed English fashions
closely is shown by the advertisement in 1758
of Theophilus Hardenbrook, surveyor, who with
unfettered fancy modestly announced that he “designs
all sorts of Buildings, Pavilions, Summer
Rooms, Seats for Gardens”; also “all sorts of
rooms after the taste of the Arabian, Chinese, Persian,
Gothic, Muscovite, Paladian, Roman, Vitruvian,
and Egyptian.”</p>

two Chippendale
chairs with backs of
entirely different design
from the splat-back
chairs previously
illustrated. Their
form was probably
suggested by that of
the slat-back chair.
Illustration <a href="#i176">176</a> is one
of a set of six, originally
owned by Joseph
Brown, one of the
four famous brothers
of Providence, whose
dignified names, John,
Joseph, Nicholas, and
Moses, have been familiarly rhymed as “John and
Josey, Nick and Mosey.” The six chairs are now
owned by their kinswoman, Mrs. David Thomas
Moore of Westbury, Long Island. Each slat is
delicately carved, and the chairs represent the finest
of this type of Chippendale chairs. Illustration <a href="#i177">177</a>
shows a chair owned by Charles R. Waters, Esq., of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>

<p>Hepplewhite’s designs
were published in 1789, and
his light and attractive furniture
soon became fashionable,
superseding that
of Chippendale, which
was pronounced “obsolete.”
Hepplewhite’s
aim was to produce a
light effect, and to this
he often sacrificed considerations
of strength
and durability.</p>

</div>

<p>While
Chippendale used no inlaying, Hepplewhite’s furniture
is ornamented with both carving and inlay,
as well as painting. His chairs may be distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
by the shape and construction of the back,
which was usually of oval, shield, or heart shape.
The carving in Hepplewhite’s chairs is of quite
a different character from that of Chippendale.
The three feathers of the Prince of Wales often
form a part of the back, for Hepplewhite was of
the Prince’s party when feeling ran strong during
the illness of George III.</p>

<p>Carved drapery, wheat,
and the bell-flower,
sometimes called
husks, are other characteristics
of Hepplewhite’s
chairs, two of
which are shown in
Illustration <a href="#i178">178</a>, belonging
to Dwight
Blaney, Esq., of Boston.
The Prince’s
feathers appear in
the middle of one
chair-back and upon
the top rail of the
other.</p>

<p>A chair is shown in Illustration <a href="#i180">180</a>, which has
features of several styles. The legs are French and
the width of the
seat; the splat joins
the seat in the manner
of Chippendale;
the anthemion design
of the splat is
in the Adam style
and the carving on
the top rail, but
the rail is Hepplewhite’s.</p>

<p>It is probably
an early Hepplewhite
chair, made before

fully formulated, and
the combination has
resulted in a beautiful
chair. It belongs
to J. J. Gilbert, Esq.,
of Baltimore.</p>

<p>The chair in Illustration
<a href="#i181">181</a> is also in
Mr. Gilbert’s collection.
Although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
shield back is generally accredited to Hepplewhite,
Adam made it before him and it was used by the
other chair-makers of his time. This chair shows
very strongly the Adam influence in the carved and
reeded legs and the fine carving, which is called
guilloche, upon the arms
and around the back and
the frame of the seat.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 182.&mdash;Hepplewhite Chair,<br />

</div>

<p>The entire chair is
beautifully carved.</p>

<p>The arm-chair shown
in Illustration <a href="#i182">182</a> has
stood since 1835 in front
of the pulpit in the Unitarian
church in Leicester,
Massachusetts, but
of its history nothing is
known for the years before
that date, when it
was probably given to
the new church, then just
starting with its young
pastor, Rev. Samuel
May. This chair, like
the one in Illustration <a href="#i181">181</a>, which it resembles, has
characteristics of different styles. It is probable
that both Hepplewhite and Sheraton had practised
their trade some years, and had made much furniture
before their books were published in 1789 and
1791, and had adopted and adapted many ideas from
the cabinet-makers and designers of the day, as well
as from each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The chair in Illustration <a href="#i183">183</a> was used by Washington
in the house occupied as the Presidential mansion
in Philadelphia. It is now owned by the Historical
Society of Pennsylvania. This chair has the same
guilloche carving as the chair in Illustration <a href="#i181">181</a>,
extending entirely around the back. The legs are
short and the chair low and wide, and this with the
stuffed back indicates that the chair is French.</p>

by the grandfather of their present owner, Charles R.
Waters, Esq., of Salem. This chair is carved upon
the legs with the bell-flower, and the three middle
rails of the back are exquisitely carved. Chairs of
this design, with the ornament of inlay instead of
carving, are also found.</p>

ebony, inlaid. This design of Hepplewhite chair
is more frequently found than any other.</p>

<p>A specialty of Hepplewhite’s
was what he terms
“a very elegant fashion.”
The chair-backs were finished
with painted or japanned
work. This was not
the lacquering which had
been fashionable during the
first half of the eighteenth
century, with Chinese figures,
but it was a process
of coating the chairs with
a sort of lacquer varnish,
and then painting them
in gold or colors upon a
black ground.</p>

<p>Haircloth was used for the seats of chairs; the
edges were finished with brass-headed nails, arranged
sometimes to simulate festoons, as in Illustration <a href="#i191">191</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>A Hepplewhite chair with a back of quite a different
design from the examples described previously,
is shown in Illustration <a href="#i189">189</a>. The back is heart-shaped,
and the ornamentation is of inlaying in light
and dark wood. This chair is one of four in the
Poore collection at Indian
Hill. They formed a
part of the set bought by
Washington for Mount
Vernon, and were in use
there at the time of his
death.</p>

<p>A chair owned by
Miss Mary Coates of
Philadelphia is shown in

is carved in the middle

     <p class="cf">Illus. 191.&mdash;Sheraton Chair.</p>
</div>

<p>Hepplewhite in turn
was superseded by Sheraton,
whose book of designs
was published in
1791, only two years later
than Hepplewhite’s; but that short time sufficed
for Sheraton to say that “this book [Hepplewhite’s]
has already caught the decline”; while he asserted
of Chippendale’s designs, that “they are now wholly
antiquated and laid aside, though possessed of great
merit, according to the times in which they were
executed.”</p>

<p>Sheraton’s chairs retained many of Hepplewhite’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
characteristics, but the great difference between them
lay in the construction of the back, which it was Sheraton’s
aim to strengthen. His chairs, except in rare
cases, do not have the heart or shield shaped back,
which distinctly marks Hepplewhite chairs, but the
back is rectangular in shape, the top rail being
curved, straight, or with a raised piece in the centre,
corresponding to the piece in the middle of the
back. A rail extends across the back a few inches
above the seat, and the splat or spindles end in this
rail, and never extend to the seat.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 192.&mdash;Sheraton Chairs.</p>

<p>Sheraton’s designs show chairs with carved, twisted,
reeded, or plain legs. The best Sheraton chairs found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in this country usually have straight legs, slightly
smaller than those upon the straight-legged Chippendale
chairs. The tapering, reeded leg, which is
characteristic of Sheraton, is not found so often
upon his chairs as upon other pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>The chair in Illustration <a href="#i191">191</a> is owned by the
Misses Nichols of Salem, and it was brought with
its mates to furnish the house built by McIntire in
1783. The chairs were imported, and as the back is
precisely like one of Sheraton’s designs in his book,
they may have been made by him, before the book
was published in 1791.</p>

<p>The impression given by this
chair is of strength combined with lightness, the
effect which Sheraton strove to attain, while at the
same time he made the chairs strong not only in effect
but in reality,
an end which Hepplewhite
did not accomplish.
The legs of
the chair are plainly
turned, but in the

are reeded.</p>

probably have been owned
by one of them rather than
by Jerome, whose career
in America was short and
meteoric. The wood of

is part of a set inherited by Waldo Lincoln, Esq.,
of Worcester.</p>

<p>The chair shown in Illustration <a href="#i198">198</a> is owned by
Mrs. J. C. Cutter of Worcester. It has a rush seat,
and the back is painted in the manner called japanning,
with gilt flowers upon a black ground. These
chairs, which were called “Fancy chairs,” were very
popular during the first part of the nineteenth century,
together with settees decorated in the same
fashion.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i199">199</a> shows two mahogany chairs
owned by Waldo Lincoln, Esq., of the styles which
were fashionable from 1840 to 1850, examples of
which may be found in almost every household,
along with heavy sofas and tables of mahogany, solid
or veneered.</p>

<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century and
in the last quarter of the eighteenth, furniture
was fashionable made of the light-colored woods;
maple, curly and bird’s-eye, and in the more expensive
pieces, satinwood, which was used chiefly as a veneer
on account of its cost. The two varieties of maple,
being a native wood and plentiful, were always used
lavishly, and rarely as a veneer. The thick maple
drawers in old bureaus have been sawed into many
thicknesses to use in violins, for which their
seasoned wood is especially valuable. The parlor
in John Hancock’s house, in Boston, was “furnished
in bird’s-eye maple covered with damask
brocade.” As Governor Hancock was a man of
inherited wealth and probably of fashion as well, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
parlor would be furnished according to the mode of
the day.</p>

<p>The three maple chairs in Illustration <a href="#i200">200</a> belong
to the writer. They were probably made about
1820 to 1830. The wood in all is beautifully marked
curly maple, and in the upper rail of two is set a
strip of bird’s-eye maple. The design of the carved
piece across the back is one that was used at this
time in both maple and mahogany chairs.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE first form of
the long seat, afterward
developed
into the sofa, was
the settle, which is found
in the earliest inventories in
this country, and still earlier
in England. The settle
oftenest seen in America
is of simple construction,
usually of pine, and painted;
probably the work of a
country cabinet-maker, or
even a carpenter. It was
made to stand by the great
fireplace, to keep the
draughts out and the heat
in, with its tall back, and
the front of the seat coming
down to the floor; and sadly was it needed in
those days when the ink froze in the standish, as
the minister sat by the fire to write his sermon.
Illustration <a href="#i201">201</a> shows a settle in the Deerfield
Museum, in the kitchen. In front of the settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
stands a flax-wheel, which kept the housewife busy
on winter evenings, spinning by the firelight.
Beside the settle is a rudely made light-stand, with
a tin lamp, and a brass candlestick with the extinguisher
on its top, and snuffers and tray beside
it. Upon one side of the settle is fastened a candlestick
with an extension frame. Behind the flax-wheel
is a banister-back chair, the plain type of the
chairs in Illustration <a href="#i139">139</a>, and at the right of the
picture is a slat-back, flag-bottomed chair such as
may be seen in Illustration <a href="#i143">143</a>.</p>

upon the back the carved date 1708. The front
of the seat has four panels, while the back has five
lower panels, with a row of small panels above. The
top rail is carved in five groups, the middle design
of each group being a crown, and between each
small panel is a turned ornament. The arms are
like the arms of the wainscot chairs in Illustration
<a href="#i124">124</a> and Illustration <a href="#i125">125</a>. The top of the seat does
not lift up, as was often the case, disclosing a box
below, but is fastened to the frame, and probably
there were provided for this settle the articles often
mentioned in inventories, “chusshings,” “quysyns,”
or cushions, which the hard seat made so necessary.
This settle belongs to Dwight Blaney, Esq., of
Boston.</p>

<p>The word “settee” is the diminutive of “settle,”
and the long seat which corresponded to the chairs
with the frame of turned wood was called a settee or
small settle, being of so much lighter build than the
settle.</p>

Essex Institute of Salem, and said to have been
brought to this country by a Huguenot family
about 1686. It is upholstered, like the chairs of
the same style, in Turkey work, the colors in which
are still bright. Turkey work was very fashionable
at that time, rugs being imported from Turkey in
shapes to fit the seat and back of chairs or settees.</p>

<p>Another form of the long seat was one which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
intended to serve as a couch, or “day-bed.” It was
really what its French name implies, <i>chaise longue</i>,
or long chair, the back being an enlarged chair-back,
and the body of the couch equalling three chair-seats.
Illustration <a href="#i204">204</a> shows a couch owned by
the Concord Antiquarian Society, which formerly
belonged to the descendants of the Rev. Peter
Bulkeley. It had originally a cane seat, and evidently
formed part of a set of furniture, for a chair
of the same style is with it, which also belonged to
the Bulkeley family. Both couch and chair are
Flemish in design, with the scroll foot turning
backward. The braces between the legs are carved
in the same design as the top of the back.</p>

</div>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i210">210</a> shows a double chair, also owned
by Mr. Flagler. It has characteristics of various
nationalities and styles, mainly Chippendale.
The back consists of two chair backs, wider than
arm-chair backs, which is almost always true of the
double chair. The corners of the seat, and the ends
of the top rails are rounding after the Dutch style,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
but the splats are Chippendale. The three front
legs end in a small claw-and-ball, and the knees are
carved. The most noticeable feature of this graceful
piece is the rococo design at the top of the back
and upon the front of the seat.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i211">211</a> shows a Chippendale double chair
and one of four arm-chairs, formerly owned by Governor
John Wentworth, whose household goods were
confiscated and sold at auction by the Federal government,
in 1776. Since that time these pieces have
been in the Alexander Ladd house at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, where they now stand. They are
a perfect exemplification of Chippendale’s furniture
in the Chinese style, and are probably the finest examples
of that style in this country. They are of
mahogany, with cane seats. The design of the backs
is more elaborate than any of the Chinese designs for
furniture of either Chippendale, Manwaring, Ince, or
Mayhew; an unusual thing, for a majority of the
designs in the old cabinet-makers’ books are far more
elaborate than the furniture which has come down to
us. Chippendale says that these “Chinese chairs are
very suitable for a lady’s boudoir, and will likewise
suit a Chinese temple.” One wonders if Governor
Wentworth had a Chinese temple for these
beautiful pieces of furniture. He had, we know,
splendid gardens, which were famous in those days,
and possibly a Chinese temple may have been
one of the adornments, with these chairs for its
furniture.</p>

known from representations of it in various books.
It is one of the finest examples existing of the Chippendale
period, and was undoubtedly, like the double
chair in Illustration <a href="#i211">211</a>, made in England. The carving
upon the three front legs is unusually good. The
feet are carved with lions’ claws, and the knees with
grotesque faces, while the arms end in dragons’ heads.</p>

<p>The corners of the back are finished with a scroll,
turning to the back. The wood of this double chair
is walnut, and it is covered in gray horsehair. This

evidently made from the same design as a long settee
in the Pendleton collection in Providence, which
has the same Chippendale carvings on the back at
the centre and ends, and the same effect of the leg
being continued up into the frame of the seat. This

The sideboard in Illustration <a href="#i75">75</a> has the same history

<p>In 1816 there was launched in Salem the yacht
called <i>Cleopatra’s Barge</i>, built and owned by Capt.
George Crowninshield, who had been a partner with
his brothers in the East India trade and had lived
from a boy upon his father’s ships. Finally retiring
from business, he built this splendid yacht with
the intention of spending years in travel, but he
died after the first long voyage to the Mediterranean.
The yacht was the wonder of the day and was visited
by thousands, not alone in Salem but in every
foreign port.</p>

<p>She was furnished with great magnificence,
in the Empire style, the woods used in the
saloon being mahogany and bird’s-eye maple, and the
two settees in the saloon were each eleven feet in
length. One is shown in Illustration <a href="#i222">222</a>, now owned
by Frederic B. Crowninshield, Esq., of Marblehead.
The backs are lyre-shaped, and when new the seats
were covered with crimson velvet and edged with
wide gold lace. The hook upon the back leg was
probably to hold the settee to the wall in bad weather.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i223">223</a> shows the influence of the fashion
for heavier and more elaborate frames, which came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in with the nineteenth century. The arms are made
after the Sheraton type shown in Illustration <a href="#i217">217</a> and
Illustration <a href="#i218">218</a>, but where a simple pillar was employed
before, this settee has a carved pineapple
forming the support to the arm, which ends in a
scroll. Instead of four front legs either plain or fluted,
there are two of larger size carved with the same
leaves which sheathe the pineapple. The covering
is horsehair, which was probably the original cover.
This settee now belongs to the Concord Antiquarian
Society, and was owned by Dr. Ezra Ripley, who
was minister of the old Congregational Church
of Concord from 1777 to 1840, and who lived in
the Old Manse, afterward occupied by Hawthorne.
The settee remained in the manse until comparatively
recent years.</p>

<p>The sofa in Illustration <a href="#i224">224</a> belongs to the Misses

The lines of this sofa are extremely elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and graceful, and its effect quite classic. The legs
are what is known as the Adam leg, which was
designed by the Adam brothers, and which Sheraton
used frequently. The style of the sofa is that of the
Adam brothers, and it was probably made from their
designs about 1800-1810. The writer has seen a window
seat which belonged to Charles Carroll of Carrollton,
after exactly this design, without the back.</p>

shed of a farmhouse, on top of a woodpile, which
made it evident what its fate would be eventually,
a fate which has robbed us of many a fine piece of
old furniture. After climbing upon a chair, then a
table, the sight of these carved feet protruding from
the woodpile was almost enough to make the antique
hunter lose her insecure footing; but with the
duplicity learned in years of collecting, all emotion
was concealed until the sofa had been secured.</p>

<p>The writer knows of four sofas, all found near Worcester,
measuring the same, seven feet in length, and with
the same carving of oak leaves upon the legs and
ends, but this is the only one of the four which has
the carved oak leaves across the front of the seat,
and the rows of incised carving upon the back rail.
The sofa was covered with black haircloth, woven
in an elaborate design, and around the edge of the
covering ran the brass beading which may be seen
in the illustration. This beading is three-eighths of
an inch wide, and is of pressed brass, filled with lead,
so that it is pliable and may be bent to go around a
curve. Such beading or trimming was used in the
place of brass-headed tacks or nails, and is found
upon chairs and sofas of about this date, 1815-1820.</p>

in large horns of plenty, the same design being repeated
in the carving of the top rail of the back
and in the legs, which end in a lion’s claw. The
round hard pillows, called “squabs,” at each end,
were always provided for sofas of this shape, to fit
into the hollow made by the curves of the cornucopia.

set of furniture bought by the father and mother of
the late Major Ben: Perley Poore, for their house at
Indian Hill, about 1840. These pieces are interesting
not only for the design of the mahogany
frames, carved with swans’ necks and heads, but for
the covering, which is of colored haircloth, woven
in a large figure in red and blue upon a gray
ground. The seat of the sofa is worn and has a
rug spread upon it, but the back and pillows and
the chair-seat are perfect.</p>

<p>From 1844 to 1848 a cabinet-maker named John
H. Belter had a shop in New York, where he manufactured
furniture, chiefly from rosewood. The
backs of the chairs and sofas were deeply curved,
and in order to obtain the strength necessary, thin
pieces of rosewood were pressed into the desired
curve, and the several thicknesses glued together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and pressed again. The strong back made in this
way was then elaborately carved, in an open-work
pattern of vines and leaves.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE earliest form of
table in use in this
country was inventoried
in 1642 as a “table
bord,” and the name occurs in
English inventories one hundred
years earlier. The name “board”
was given quite literally from
the table top, which was a board
made separately from the supporting
trestles, and which, after
a meal, was taken off the trestles,
and both board and trestles were
put away, thus leaving the room
free. These tables were long
and narrow, and had in earliest times a long bench
or form at one side only, the other side of the board
being left free for serving. In the Bolles collection
is a veritable “borde” rescued from the attic of a deserted
house, where it had stood for scores of years.
The board is about twelve feet long and two feet
one inch wide, and bears the mark of many a knife.
It rests upon three rude trestles, presenting a wonderfully
interesting example of the “table borde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>”
of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and
one which is extremely rare.</p>

<p>It will be easily seen how the expression “the
festive board” originated. Presently it became the
custom to leave
the board upon its
trestles, instead
of removing both,
and in time the
piece was called
a table, which
name covered
both board and
trestles. Some
of the different
forms of the table
mentioned in inventories
are
framed and joined
tables, chair tables,
long tables,
drawing-tables,
square, oval, and
round tables.
The framed and
joined tables refer
to the frame beneath the board. The other tables
derive their names from the shape or construction
of the tops. A drawing-table was one made with
extension pieces at each end, supported when out
by wooden braces, and folding back under or over
the table top when not in use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>A chair table is shown in Illustration <a href="#i232">232</a>. The
table top is put back in the illustration, so that the
piece can be pushed against the wall and used as a
chair. Chair tables always had the drawer beneath
the seat. They are inventoried as early as 1644.
This chair table belongs to Dwight Blaney, Esq., of
Boston.</p>

<p>These stands came to be known as “Dutch Tea-Tables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>”
and the bases were often elaborately carved.
The tops of the handsomest tables were carved out
of a thick piece of wood, so as to leave a rim, to
keep the china from sliding off. This carved rim was
in different forms, the finest being what is now called
“pie-crust,” with an ogee scallop. The plain rim
is now known as the “dish-top.” Illustration <a href="#i245">245</a>

of the finest type of tea-tables.
They are owned by Harry
Harkness Flagler,
Esq. One has the
pie-crust edge, and
the other a scalloped
edge. The pillars of
both are reeded, and
the legs are carved.
A great difference
can be noted between
these two bases, in the sweep of the spreading legs,
and in the claw-and-ball feet, which are especially
fine upon the pie-crust table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The proportion of
this table are unusually good, the central pillar being
slender, and the finely carved legs having a spread
which gives a very
graceful and light
effect.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i248">248</a>

chair is described upon

a heavier pillar than the pie-crust table in the last
illustration, and
the legs have a
smaller spread.</p>

table from falling off. Both of these tables were
used as tea-tables, the raised rims protecting the
tea-cups, more precious then than now.</p>

<p>Stands were made in different sizes, one being
intended for a “light-stand” to hold the candlestick,
and the smallest for a tea-kettle stand, to accompany
the tea-table. Illustration <a href="#i251">251</a> shows three sizes of
stands, all smaller than those illustrated previously,
and giving somewhat the effect of the three bears of
the nursery tale. The middle stand, which has a
dish-top, has a base which is exquisitely carved. The
tiny kettle-stand is only eighteen and one-half inches
high. These three stands also belong to Mr. Flagler.</p>

<p>The exquisite Chippendale card-table shown in

frames what is a monument to the industry of the
frail young girls who embroidered the top, and to the
good housekeeping of its owners for one hundred and
twenty odd years. The colors in this embroidery
are as brilliant as when new, and never a moth has
been suffered to even sniff at its stitches, which are
the smallest I have ever seen. The work is done
upon very fine linen, and each thread is covered with
a stitch of embroidery, done with the slenderest
possible strands of crewel, in designs of playing-cards,
and of round and fish-shaped counters, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>

other gave it up with her life. The same young
girls embroidered the screen in Illustration <a href="#i328">328</a>.

<p>A style of
table popular
during the eighteenth
century
was called a
Pembroke table,
according to
Sheraton, from
the name of the
lady who first
ordered one, and
who probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
gave the idea to the workman. Illustration <a href="#i256">256</a>
shows a Pembroke table in the Chippendale style,
with rather unusual stretchers between the legs.
The characteristic which gives a table the name of
Pembroke consists in the drop
leaves, which are held up, when
the table is open, by brackets
which turn under the top. The
shape of the top varies, being
square, round, oval, or with leaves
shaped like the table in the illustration.
They are always small,
and were designed for breakfast
tables. This table belongs to the
Concord Antiquarian Society.</p>

<p>A beautiful Pembroke table
owned by the Metropolitan Museum
of Art is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i257">257</a>. It is made of mahogany
entirely veneered with curly
sycamore, with a band of tulip
wood around the top and leaves,
which are exquisitely inlaid in
a circular design, and upon the
legs are lines of holly with an
oval inlay at the top.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i258">258</a> shows a set or “nest” of Chinese
tea tables owned by Dwight M. Prouty, Esq. They
and the tea caddy case are lacquered in black with
Chinese scenes in gold. These sets of tables were
brought by ships in the Chinese trade, and were
fashionable among the tea drinkers of early times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>From about 1786 the designs of Shearer, Hepplewhite,
and Sheraton entirely superseded the fashions
of the fifty years preceding, and the slender tapering
leg took the place of the cabriole leg. Illustration
<a href="#i259">259</a> shows a Hepplewhite card-table, of about 1789,
with inlaid legs, one of which swings around to support
half of the top,
which is circular when
open.</p>

bags. The table top has an opening in the centre,
which originally had a wooden cover, and the space
below the top was utilized to hold the work. At
the back of the top are two short turned posts supporting
a little shelf, to hold a candlestick, or to

<p>Illustrations <a href="#i268">268</a> and

Prouty, Esq. The legs
and frame of the upper
table are of mahogany,
the box being made of
pine and covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
pleated silk. The lower table is more elegant in
shape, with a slide, the front of which simulates
a drawer, and to this is attached the work bag or
box, in this table made of wood, silk-covered, but
sometimes made of silk alone.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i270">270</a> shows a Hepplewhite dining
table, the drop leaf serving to increase the length
of the table, when raised and held up by the extra
leg, which swings under it. Up to 1800 the
dining-table had been made in various styles,
in all of which the table legs were more or
less in the way of those around the table. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the “hundred-legged” table there seemed to be
a table leg for each person. Then came the cabriole
leg, also in the way, and finally the Hepplewhite
dining-table, which was made in sections, with
rounded ends, and four legs on each end.</p>

<p>About 1800 the pillar-and-claw table was invented,
which made it possible for several persons to sit
around a dining-table without a part of the guests
encircling the table legs with their own. These
tables were made in pairs or in threes, one after
another being added as more room was required.</p>

<p>The pillar and claw design was most popular and
was used for centre tables, bases of piano stools,

pillar-and-claw mahogany centre table with drop
leaves is shown in Illustration <a href="#i272">272</a>. The feet are
lion’s claws, and from this date the lion’s or bear’s
claw foot was used for furniture with carved feet,
instead of the bird’s claw-and-ball which had been
so largely used during the previous century.</p>

<p>The legs end in small lion’s feet and are carved, like the posts,
with the typical Phyfe leaf. This leaf, so much used by Phyfe, is seen,
like the lyre, upon Adam pieces, and apparently the Scotchman, Duncan
Phyfe, took the Scotchman, Robert Adam, for his model. The fashion of
heavy furniture elaborately carved was more popular in the South than
in the North, and the most ornate pieces are found in the South,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> of
later date than the rich carving done in Philadelphia, upon pie-crust
tables and high-boys. Heavy posts carved with the acanthus and
pineapple and other Empire features found favor.</p>

<p>It is probable
that during the first quarter
of the nineteenth century
the wealthy Southern planters
refurnished their homes in the
prevailing Empire style. The
pier-table in Illustration <a href="#i279">279</a> is
one of a pair found in Virginia,
which were made about 1830.
The chief motif in the design
seems to be dolphins’ heads,
which form the feet, and the
base of the front supports to
the top.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">SPINETS, virginals, and
harpsichords were
brought to the American
colonies in English
ships as early as 1645, when
“An old pair of virginalls”
appears in an inventory; and
another, in 1654. In 1667 a
pair of virginals is valued at
two pounds. In his diary of
1699 Judge Samuel Sewall
alludes to his wife’s virginals.
In 1712 the Boston <i>News
Letter</i> contained an advertisement
that “the spinet would
be taught,” and in 1716 the
public were requested to
“Note, that any Persons may have all Instruments
of Music mended, or Virginals or Spinets strung &amp;
tun’d, at a Reasonable Rate, and likewise may be
taught to play on any of the Instruments above
mentioned.” From the wording of this advertisement
it is evident that these instruments were no
novelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>I have not been able to learn of an existing virginal
which was in use in this country, but occasionally
a spinet is found. The expression a “pair”
or “set” of virginals was used in the same manner
as a “pair” or “set” of steps or stairs, and in England
an oblong spinet was called a virginal, in distinction
from the spinet of triangular shape, which
superseded the rectangular, oblong form in which
the earliest spinets were made. Both virginal and
spinet had but one string to a key, and the tone
of both was produced by a sort of plectrum which
picked the string. This plectrum usually consisted
of a crow quill, set in an upright piece of wood,
called a “jack,” which was fastened to the back of
the key. The depressing of the key by the finger
caused the quill to rise, and as it passed the string,
the vibration produced the musical tone, which is
described by Dr. Burney as “A scratch with a sound
at the end of it.” The name of the spinet is by
some supposed to be derived from these quills,&mdash;from
<i>spina</i>, a thorn. According to other authorities
the name came from a maker of the instrument,
named Spinetti. The virginal was so called because
young maids were wont to play upon it, among them
that perennial young girl, Queen Elizabeth. The
most famous makers of spinets in England were
Charles Haward or Haywood, Thomas and John
Hitchcock, and Stephen Keene. In Pepys’s diary
are the following entries:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“April 4, 1668. Called upon one Haward that makes virginalls,
and there did like of a little espinette and will have him
finish it for me; for I had a mind to a small harpsichon, but this
takes up less room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">“July 15, 1668. At noon is brought home the espinette I
bought the other day of Haward; cost me 5£.”</p>

<p class="p1">Illustration <a href="#i281">281</a> shows a spinet in the Deerfield
Museum, which formerly belonged to Miss Sukey
Barker of Hingham, who must have been a much
envied damsel. It is marked Stephanus Keene,
which places the date of its make about 1690. The
body of the spinet stands twenty-four inches from
the floor. Its extreme length is fifty-six inches,
and the keyboard of four and one-half octaves
measures twenty-nine inches. There are but six
keys left, but they are enough to show that the
naturals were black and the sharps white. There
is a row of fine inlaying above the keyboard, and
the maker’s name is surrounded with painted flowers.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 281.&mdash;Stephen Keene Spinet, about 1690.</p>
</div>

<p>The spinet, as may be seen, was a tiny instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in shape similar to our modern grand piano. The
body of the spinet was entirely separate from the
stand, which was made with stretchers between the
legs, of which there were three and sometimes four,
so placed that one leg came under the narrow back
end of the spinet, one under the right end of the
front, and one or sometimes two at the left of the
front. The instrument rested upon this table or
trestle.</p>

<p>The name upon the majority of spinets found
in this country is that of Thomas Hitchcock. His
spinets are numbered and occasionally dated. There
is a Thomas Hitchcock spinet owned by the Concord
Antiquarian Society, numbered 1455, and one
owned in Worcester, numbered 1519.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i282">282</a> shows a spinet which was owned
by Elizabeth Hunt Wendell of Boston. It was
probably an old instrument when she took it with
her from Boston to Portland in 1766 upon her
marriage to the Rev. Thomas Smith, known as
Parson Smith of Portland. It is now owned by
her great-great-grandaughter in Gorham, Maine.
The board above the keys has two lines of inlaying
around it, and is marked “Thomas Hitchcock
Londoni fecit, 1390.” The front of the white keys
is cut with curved lines, and the black keys have a
line of white ivory down the centre. The parrot-back
chair in the illustration is described upon
page 168. Authorities seem to vary upon dates
when the Hitchcocks made spinets. Mr. A. J.
Hipkins of London, the well-known authority upon
pianos, harpsichords, and spinets, writes me that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
dates the Thomas Hitchcock spinets from 1664 to
1703, and those of John Hitchcock, the son of
Thomas, from 1676 to about 1715. Mr. Hipkins
says that the highest number he has met with upon
Thomas Hitchcock’s spinets is 1547, so it is safe to
date this spinet in Illustration <a href="#i282">282</a>, which numbers
1390, to about 1690.</p>

<p>By the latter half of the eighteenth century proficiency
upon various musical instruments was not
uncommon. John Adams in 1771 speaks of a
young man of twenty-six, as “a great proficient in
music, plays upon the flute, fife, harpsichord, spinet,
etc.; a very fine Connecticut young gentleman.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1768 in the <i>Boston Chronicle</i> appears the advertisement
of John Harris, recently from England, “that
he makes and sells all sorts of Harpsichords and
Spinets,” and in 1769 the <i>Boston Gazette</i> says, “A
few days since was shipped for Newport a very
curious Spinet, being the first one ever made in
America, the performance of the ingenious Mr.
John Harris.” In 1770 the same paper praises an
excellent “spinet” made by a Bostonian, “which
for goodness of workmanship and harmony of sound
is esteemed by the best judges to be superior to any
that has been imported from Europe.” This would
seem to indicate that a tone of superiority in musical
matters was assumed by Boston at an early date.
The statement with regard to the first spinet made
in America is incorrect, for over twenty years
earlier, in 1742, Hasselinck had made spinets in
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In the Essex Institute of Salem is a spinet made
by Samuel Blythe of Salem, the bill for which, dated
1786, amounts to eighteen pounds.</p>

<p>The harpsichord, so named from its shape, was
the most important of the group of contemporary
instruments, the virginal, spinet, and harpsichord,
the tone of which was produced with the quill and
jack. The harpsichord had two strings to each
key, and the instrument occupied the relative position
that the grand piano does to-day, being much
larger and having more tone than the spinet. Like
the spinet, its manufacture ceased with the eighteenth
century. Illustration <a href="#i283">283</a> shows a harpsichord
formerly owned by Charles Carroll, who was so
eager to identify himself as a patriot, that he signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
his name to the Declaration of Independence as
Charles Carroll of Carrollton. This harpsichord
was discovered twenty-five years ago in the loft of
an old college building in Annapolis, where it had
lain for fifty years. The Carroll coat of arms, painted
upon porcelain and framed in gold, is fastened above
the keyboard. The inscription upon this instrument
is “Burkat Shudi et Johannes Broadwood,
patent No. 955 Londini, Fecerant 1789, Great
Poulteney Street, Golden Square.”</p>

<p>There are two banks of keys, with a range of five
octaves, and three stops, which were intended to
change the tone, two of them being marked harp
and lute. The case is quite plain, of mahogany,
with a few lines of inlaying above the keyboard and
a line around the body and top. It is owned by
William Knabe &amp; Co. of Baltimore, and is one of
fourteen Broadwood harpsichords known to exist.</p>

<p>That the harpsichord was not an uncommon instrument
in this country during the latter half of
the eighteenth century is shown by the number of
advertisements of the harpsichord and its teachers.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i284">284</a> shows a clavichord or clavier,
made about 1745. It is owned by Mr. John Orth
of Boston. The clavichord, like its successor, the
square piano, was of oblong shape. The musical
tone was produced in a different manner from that
of either the spinet or piano. Each key had at the
back an upright “tangent” or wedge-shaped piece
of brass, which, as the front of the key was depressed,
rose and set the string of twisted brass
wire in vibration, by pressing upon it, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
picking it like the quill of the spinet and harpsichord.
This pressure divided the string into two
different lengths, the shorter length being prevented
from vibrating by a band of cloth interlaced with
the strings. The same interlaced cloth stopped the
vibration of the longer division of the string, as soon
as the pressure was taken from the key, thus allowing
the tangent to fall. In the earlier clavichords
one string had to serve to produce the tone for two
or three different keys.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <p class="cf">Illus. 284.&mdash;Clavichord, 1745.</p>
</div>

<p>These instruments were
called “gebunden,” or fretted. Later instruments
are “bund frei” or free, having a string for each key.
The clavichord player could feel the elasticity of the
wire string, and could produce a sort of vibration of
tone by employing the same method as that used in
playing the violin, a pressure and vibration of the
fleshy end of the finger while the note was held.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
The tone of the clavichord was very delicate, and it
afforded far more power of expression than the
spinet or harpsichord, which, however, were more
brilliant, and entirely superseded the weaker clavichord
in England. In Germany the clavichord has
always been a favorite instrument even into the
nineteenth century. It is probable that but few
clavichords came to this country.</p>

<p>The <i>piano e forte</i>&mdash;soft and loud&mdash;was invented
about 1720. The strings of the piano are struck by
hammers instead of being picked by quills, and the
force of the hammer strokes made a stronger frame
necessary than that of the spinet or harpsichord, in
order to hold the heavier strings.</p>

<p>Brissot de Warville wrote in 1788 that in Boston
“one sometimes hears the forte piano, though the
art is in its infancy.” He then soulfully bursts
forth, “God grant that the Bostonian women may
never, like those of France, acquire the malady of
perfection in this art. It is never attained but at the
expense of the domestic virtues.” According to this
the domestic virtues must be a scarce quality in
Boston at the present time.</p>

<p>In 1792 Messrs. Dodd &amp; Claus, musical instrument
manufacturers, 66 Queen Street, New York,
announced that “the forte piano is become so fashionable
in Europe that few polite families are without
it.” As this country kept pace with Europe in
the fashions, we can assume that the forte piano
formed at the close of the eighteenth century a part
of the furniture of the polite families of the United
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>The date of a piano can be approximately determined
by its legs. The earliest pianos had four
slender legs similar to the legs of the spinet or harpsichord.
The next instruments had six legs, increased
in size and fluted or carved. Then the
number was reduced to four, and the legs were still
larger, and more elaborately carved, until 1840
the ugly legs found commonly upon the square
piano were the only styles employed.</p>

</div>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i285">285</a> is a fine example of an early pianoforte.
Like the spinet and clavichord, the body
of the instrument is separate from the lower frame,
which is fastened together at the corners with large
screws like a bedstead. This may have been for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
convenience in transportation, and it is possible that
while the top containing the works was imported,
the supporting frame may have been made in this
country. There are four slender inlaid legs, and one
pedal, and under the body of the piano runs a most
convenient shelf for music. The case is of mahogany,
with rows of fine inlaying in colors, having
two rows of different width around the top of the
lid. The board above the keys is of satinwood, and
it has, beside the delicate frets at each side, charmingly
painted garlands of sweet peas, a flower very popular
in England at that time, about 1805. The
name plate has the inscription “Muzio Clementi &amp;
Co., Cheapside, London,” and the number of the
piano is 3653. It measures sixty-seven inches in
length, and has a compass of five and one-half octaves.
There is a line of inlaying around the inside
of this piano, which is finished carefully in every
detail. The music-rack is of simple form like the
rack in Illustration <a href="#i286">286</a>. The music may also rest,
as in the illustration, upon the edge of the lid, when
put back. This piano is owned by the writer, who
bought it in Falmouth, Massachusetts. It was said
to be the first piano brought into Falmouth, or upon
the “Cape,” and in looking at this dainty instrument,
which had never left the room in which it found its
home, a hundred years ago, one can imagine the
wonder and envy of the little seaport village when a
whaling captain, after a successful voyage, gave the
piano to his daughter. Nothing could sound more
quaint than a Gluck or Mozart minuet played upon
its tinkling keys.</p>

<p>The founder of the Astor family about 1790 to
1800 made one branch of his business the importing
of pianos, which were labelled with his name
and which are quite commonly met with. Illustration
<a href="#i286">286</a> shows an Astor piano owned by Mrs.
Sanford Tappan of Newburyport. The style of
this piano is similar to that of the “Clementi” in
Illustration <a href="#i285">285</a>, but it lacks the delicate ornamentation
of the Clementi piano. In the <i>Columbian Centinel</i>
of 1806 is an advertisement with a woodcut of an
instrument very like this.</p>

<p>There is an Astor piano in Salem, described as
having four legs in the front, indicating that it was
made as late as 1815. It had two pedals, one being
used to prolong the tones. The other pedal served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to produce a novel and taking effect, by lifting a
section of the top of the piano lid, which was then
allowed to fall suddenly, the slamming serving to
imitate the firing of cannon. The young lady who
owned the piano created a great sensation by playing
battle pieces with this startling accompaniment.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i287">287</a> shows the change in the legs, this
piano having six legs, which are considerably larger.
The piano was made by Clementi, and is numbered
10522. It is of light mahogany, and has a row of
dark mahogany veneer around its frame. The feet
and tops of the six legs are of brass, like the handles
to the three drawers, and a brass moulding goes
around the frame. The piano stool, also of mahogany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
is of a somewhat later date. This piano
and stool are owned by W. S. G. Kennedy, Esq.,
of Worcester. This style of piano was in use from
1820 to 1830.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i288">288</a> shows one of the curious combinations
which the cabinet-makers of about 1800
seemed to be so fond of designing. Their books
have complicated drawings of tables and desks with
mechanical devices for transforming the simple-looking
piece of furniture into one full of compartments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
drawers, and boxes, with contrivances which
allow surprising combinations to spring out. Sheraton,
who was a shrewd observer, said, “A fancifulness
seems most peculiar to the taste of females”;
and this piece of furniture was made, apparently, to
appeal to that “fancifulness.”</p>

<p>Between the works
of the piano and the cover is a tray divided into
compartments to hold toilet and writing utensils,
ink-bottle, sand-sifter, stationery, pins, and sewing-implements,
and over the keyboard rests a long
tray for similar articles. These trays can be removed
when the piano is to be used. There is a
front panel which lets down, forming a writing-table,
and a mirror is set in the face of the rest that supports
the lid when raised.</p>

<p>Thus the lady for whom
all this was designed, after using it as a dressing-table,

<p>In 1829 the manufacture of pianofortes had increased
so that during that year twenty-five hundred
pianos were made in the United States, chiefly in
New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.</p>

<p>The piano in Illustration <a href="#i289">289</a> belongs to Mrs. Ada
Grisier of Auburn, Indiana, and is an unusually fine
specimen of the six-legged piano fashionable about
1830. The case is of mahogany and is inlaid with
lines of brass, while around the body run two rows,
of different width, of brass moulding. The legs are
large, and elaborately carved, and are set in brass
standards. On each corner of the frame is a design
in gilt. There is one wooden pedal, and the range
of the piano is five and one-half octaves. The name
of the maker has been obliterated.</p>

<p>The piano in Illustration <a href="#i290">290</a> is owned by Mrs.
Louis M. Priest of Salem, New York. The body is
of rosewood inlaid with brass, the lid being of
mahogany, like the elaborately carved trestle-shaped
supports. It has two drawers for holding music,
and one pedal, the standard for which is a carved
lyre with a mirror behind its strings. The keyboard
has a range of six octaves. The name upon
the front is Peter Erben, 103 Pump St., New York.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Peter Erben was a music-teacher whose address from
1826 to 1827 was 103 Pump Street, which determines
the date of this piano. The writer knows
of four pianos with the carved mahogany trestle-supports,
all with the name of Peter Erben as
maker, though it is probable that, like modern
pianos, the works were bought, and whoever wished
might have his name upon the name-plate, since
Peter Erben is in the New York directories for
thirty years as “Musick teacher” or “Professor of
musick” only.</p>

<p>The piano-stool in Illustration <a href="#i291">291</a> was made to
use with the piano in Illustration <a href="#i290">290</a>. The wide

gives the effect of a table
base, but there is no doubt
that this was made originally
to use for a piano-stool.
The little weather-beaten
house, in which
the piano and stool had
always stood, possesses a
ghost story of a young girl
who was starved to death
by her miser brother,
and who was said to
haunt the house. This
piano and stool give the
impression of the reverse of a miser, and the poor
ghost must have been before their day. The stool
is now owned by the writer, but is neither practical
nor comfortable, the feet being much in the way.</p>

design, made about 1826. There is no maker’s
name upon the piano. The frame is of mahogany
and has a brass moulding around the body, and
brass rosette handles to the drawers. Around each
square carved panel upon the front legs is a brass
beading, and the lions’ claws on the front legs and
the sockets upon the back legs are of brass.</p>

legs was sold with a piano made by Wood, Small,
&amp; Co., of London, which has six legs fluted in the
same manner. The other stool has a base like the
claw-and-pillar table, and the sides of the seat are
carved dolphins, whose tails turn up and support a
carved rail to form a low back for the seat. This
stool belongs to the writer.</p>

concealed as one stands by this piano, and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>

to have remained unchanged for many years, and
from the earliest piano shown, made in 1800, until
the large square piano of 1840, the music-rack is the
same, simply constructed of four pieces of wood which
are put together with pivots, so that by pushing
one end of the top piece they all slide and fold down
together, in order that the piano may be closed.</p>

The dulcimer of early times was a small,

the dulcimer and its hammers.</p>

“pictures, taste,

and the musical
glasses.”
This was in
1761, and the
musical glasses
were fashionable before that, for Gluck in 1746 played
“a concerto on twenty-six drinking glasses, tuned
with spring water.” Franklin invented an instrument
for the musical glasses, which he called the
Armonica, for which famous composers wrote music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>

into it.</p>

of a visit to Franklin
in Paris. It says: “He
conducted me across the
room to an instrument of
his own invention which he
called the ‘Armonica.’ The
music was produced by a
peculiar combination of
hemispherical glasses. He
played upon it and performed
some Scotch pastorales
with great effect.
The exhibition was truly
striking.”</p>

over the country, one being in the Brown collection
of musical instruments in the Metropolitan Museum

there have been practically no square pianos manufactured.
This piano was made by Henry Hawkey
of New York, about 1845, and it is noteworthy because
the keys are made of mother-of-pearl, and the
scrolls above the keyboard are inlaid in mother-of-pearl.
The case is covered
with rosewood veneering,
and the legs are large and
clumsy. The music-rack

</div>

<p>Proficiency upon the
piano and spinet would
appear to have comprised
the chief accomplishments
in instrumental music of
the young ladies of the
eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, as far as
we can judge by mention
of such accomplishments.
But it seems reasonable
to suppose that where a
few English ladies employed
their fair hands
upon the harp, there were
not lacking a similar number
of Americans who
also appreciated the opportunity
which that classic
instrument affords of displaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the grace and beauty of a rounded arm
and wrist. Even in our own day, the list of those
who play the harp is restricted, and it must have
been the same in early days, hence the lack of
allusions to the harp. When Lady Morgan, the
“wild Irish girl,” was creating such a sensation in
London with her harp-playing, it is certain that
she had imitators in this country.</p>

<p>Christopher Columbus Baldwin, in his diary of
1832, speaks of Madam Papanti, who at that time
lived in Worcester with her husband, the famous
dancing-teacher. She gave music lessons, possibly
upon the harp, for Mr. Baldwin tells of her playing
that instrument upon Sundays at Dr. Bancroft’s
church, while her husband played the French horn,
“which, with two flutes, a base viol, and violin, make
very good musick.”</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i307">307</a> shows a very beautiful harp made
previous to 1800, belonging to Mrs. Reed Lawton
of Worcester. In construction it is not very different
from the modern harp, although considerably
smaller. It is exquisitely carved, and instead of
being gilded is painted in colors, and finished with
a varnish like the vernis martin, the general effect
being a golden brown. The harp which Marie
Antoinette played upon is still preserved, and is
very like this one.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN wood was
plentiful and easily
gathered, the fireplace
was built of generous
proportions. At the back,
lying in the ashes, was the
backlog, sometimes so huge
that a chain was attached to
it, and it was dragged in by
a horse. The forestick rested
upon the andirons, and small
sticks filled the space between
backlog and forestick.
In the wall beside the fireplace
was built the brick
oven, in which the baking
was done. Upon baking
day a wood fire was made
inside this oven, and when
the oven was thoroughly
heated, the coals were removed,
and the bread placed
upon the oven bottom to bake leisurely. The tin
kitchen was set before the fire, and pies and bread
upon its shelves were cooked by the heat reflected
and radiated from the tin hood.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i308">308</a> shows a great
kitchen fireplace in the Lee mansion
in Marblehead, Massachusetts,
with the tin kitchens in front of the
fire, and the kettles
and pots
hanging over it,
and the various
kitchen utensils
around it.</p>

<p>Fire-dogs or
andirons are mentioned
in the earliest
inventories.</p>

<p>The name “fire-dogs”
came from
the heads of animals
with which
the irons were
ornamented.
“Andirons” is a
word corrupted
from “hand
irons,” although
some inventories speak of end-irons. Kitchen andirons
were of iron similar to the ones in Illustration
<a href="#i316">316</a>, but for the other fireplaces they were made
of steel, copper, or brass, and in England even of
silver.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i311">311</a>
shows a pair of
“Hessians” made
of iron. Andirons
of this style were
very popular immediately
after the
Revolutionary War,
the figures of the
hated allies of the British thus receiving the
treatment with flame and ashes that Americans considered
the originals to merit, to say nothing of
worse indignities cast upon them by the circle of
tobacco-smoking patriots.</p>

<p>Andirons were made of different heights, and
sometimes two or more sets were used in one fireplace,
to hold larger and smaller sticks. Creepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
are mentioned in early inventories. They were low
irons placed between the andirons, to hold short
sticks.</p>

<p>As wood grew less plentiful, and as the forests
near by were cleared away, it was not so easy to
obtain the huge backlog and the great pile of sticks
to fill the generous fireplace, and by the middle
of the eighteenth century its size had diminished.
Many of the larger ones were partially filled in.
The fireplace in the Ipswich Whipple house, when
the house was bought by the society which now
owns it, had been bricked in twice&mdash;once to make
the space less, and the second time to fill it in
entirely and put a fire-frame in its place. Chimneys
which did not smoke were the exception until
Count Rumford made his researches in heat and
light, and by his discoveries and improvements in
construction enabled our ancestors to have chimneys
which did not smoke, and which did not carry up
the greater portion of the heat from the fire.</p>

earlier than in this

<p>By 1650 the use of
coal had become common
in England from
the scarcity and expense
of wood as a
fuel, and from that
time fireplaces in that
country were constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
for coal fires. The books of designs of
the eighteenth century show many and elaborate
drawings of grates for coal. In this country,
however, the lack of wood has never been felt,
and the fireplace to burn wood has held its own,
with its andirons, not so generous as in the early
days, but still of goodly size.</p>

<p>Firebacks were made of iron for fireplaces, sometimes
cast with the coat-of-arms of the owner or the
date of construction. In Pennsylvania were famous
iron workers, and there is a collection of
iron firebacks in the museum at Memorial Hall,
Philadelphia. At Mount Vernon is a fireback
with the Fairfax coat-of-arms which Washington
took from Belvoir, the estate of Lord Fairfax, adjoining
Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i317">317</a> shows a chimney piece in the west
parlor at Mount Vernon. Washington’s coat-of-arms
is carved at the top, and his crest and initials
are cast in the fireback. In the panel over the
mantel is a painting which was sent to Lawrence
Washington in 1743, by Admiral Vernon, in acknowledgment
of the courtesy shown by Lawrence
Washington to his old commander, in naming the
estate Mount Vernon. The painting represents
Admiral Vernon’s fleet at Cartagena.</p>

<p>About 1750 the hob-grate was invented. Illustration
<a href="#i318">318</a> shows a mantel and fireplace with a hob-grate
in the house of Charles R. Waters, Esq., of
Salem. The fireplace was filled in with brick or
stone at each side, and the grate set between.</p>

<p>The bars, of course, are of iron for holding coal, and the
sides of the grate are of brass. These were at first
called “cat-stones” to distinguish them from “fire-dogs,”
but later they were named “hob-grates.”</p>

is a fender of iron wire with brass rails and feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The hob-grate was more in use in the South than
in the North.</p>

<p>In 1745, after many experiments, and goaded to
it by the smoking chimneys and wasted heat of the
fireplace, Franklin invented the stove in use ever
since, called the Franklin stove or grate. Illustration
<a href="#i319">319</a> shows a Franklin stove in the Warner house
at Portsmouth. The fireplace, faced with tiles, was
originally built to burn wood, but when the new-fashioned
Franklin stove became popular, one was
bought and set into the fireplace, the front of the
stove projecting into the room. The stove is made
of iron, with the three rosettes, the open-work rail
at the top, the large knobs in front and the small
knobs at the back, of brass, which every good housekeeper
kept as brightly polished as the brass andirons
and the handles of the shovel and tongs. At
each side of the fireplace are the original brass rests
for the shovel and tongs.</p>

<p>Later in the century the fireplace was filled in
with a board or bricks, and what was called a fire-frame
was used. It was similar to the upper part
of a Franklin stove; the back and sides of iron,
somewhat larger than those of the Franklin stove,
resting directly upon the stone hearth, giving the
effect of an iron fireplace in front of the old one.
Oftentimes in an old house may be found a large
fireplace filled in, with the iron fire-frame in front
of it, that in its turn superseded by a stove placed
with its pipe passing through the fire-frame. Illustration

<p>Candles and whale oil, with pine-wood knots, provided
the light for the Pilgrim fathers, aside from
that thrown out by the great wood fire. Candlesticks
formed a necessary part of the furnishings of
a house. They were made of brass, iron, tin, pewter,
and silver, but candlesticks of brass were the
ones in most general use.</p>

Century.</p>
</div>

<p>The earliest form of lamp in use in the colonies
was what is known as a “betty lamp,” and it must
have been a most untidy little utensil, giving but a
meagre light. Illustration <a href="#i321">321</a> shows several betty
lamps owned by the writer. The smallest is of
iron, two and a half inches in diameter, with a nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
projecting one inch and a quarter beyond the receptacle
for grease or fat.</p>

<p>A chain and hook are
attached to the
handle, by which
the lamp was hung
upon a chair-back
or a nail. The
wick, made of a
twisted cotton rag,
was placed with its
end protruding
from the nose of
the lamp, and provided
a dull, poor
flame. Another
lamp has the chain
and the receptacle
for grease made of
brass, while the
handle, the hook
by which it was to
hang, and the pin
for cleaning the
lamp, attached to
the chain, are of
steel. The bottom
of the brass receptacle
is of copper.
There is a
cover to the front
part of this lamp,
so that the interior
can be cleaned, and the piece of steel forming the
handle runs through the interior of the lamp, the
end providing a nose for the wick just inside of
the brass one, thus allowing the drippings from
the wick to drain back into the receptacle.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>The lamp with a standard has an iron rod, upon which
the lamp can slide up and down, with a ring at
the top of the rod to lift it by. The fourth betty
lamp is hung upon an old wooden ratchet intended
for that purpose. The ratchet is made of two
strips of wood, one cut with saw-teeth edge, which
can be raised and lowered to place the lamp at the
desired height. Betty lamps were in use during
the seventeenth century, and much later than that
in the South.</p>

<p>As early as 1696, inventories mention a “Candle-stand
for two brass candlesticks.” Illustration <a href="#i322">322</a>
shows two of these candle-stands in the collection
of the late Major Ben Perley Poore at Indian Hill.
The larger stand is made of iron, and was fashioned
by the local blacksmith, near Indian Hill. It was
taken by the grandfather of Major Poore to Harvard
University when he went there a student in
1776. The tongs hanging upon this stand are a
smoker’s tongs, for lifting a coal from the fire to
light the pipe, the curved end on one side of the
handle being used to press the tobacco into the pipe,
or to clean it out. The three feet of the other stand
are of iron, and the pole, candlesticks, and two pairs
of snuffers are of brass. These stands probably were
made during the first half of the eighteenth century.
The room, a corner of which shows in the illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
is fitted with panels from the “Province
House,” the home at one time of Agnes Surriage.
The pillars showing behind the candle-stands were
taken from the old Brattle Street Church in Boston
when it was pulled down. One end of a Sheraton
sofa may be seen in the picture, and several of the
illustrations for this book were taken in this fine
room.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i324">324</a> shows two candlesticks owned by
the writer. The one shaped like a mug with a
handle is of Sheffield plate, and was made for use
in a sick-room or any place where it was necessary
to burn a light during the entire night. There
should be a glass chimney to fit into the candlestick
and protect the flame from draughts. The
open-work band around the candlestick allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the passage of air, thus insuring a clear flame. The
long-handled extinguisher upon the rest provided
for it was to put out the light of a candle which
was protected by a
chimney or by glass
shades such as are in
Illustration <a href="#i323">323</a>.</p>

<p>The other candlestick is
of brass, with extinguisher
and snuffers
which were made to
fit the candlestick,
the ordinary handleless
extinguisher serving
to put out the
flame of any candle
unprotected by a
chimney or shade.</p>

<p>In 1784 a Frenchman
named Argand
invented the lamp
still called by his
name. The first Argand
lamp brought
to this country was
given by Thomas Jefferson to Charles Thomson.
These lamps gave what was then considered to be a
brilliant and even dazzling light, but their price
placed them beyond the reach of ordinary folk,
who continued to use tallow candles. Wax candles
were burned by the wealthy, in candlesticks and
sconces, and occasionally in chandeliers.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i325">325</a> shows a rich
chandelier for candles, in the Warner
house, at Portsmouth. It was
probably brought to this country
about 1765, the same date that
other handsome furnishings were
bought for this house. The metal
work of this chandelier is of
brass. Chandeliers with glass drops
are spoken of in the sixteenth century,
coming from Venice.</p>

<p>Eliza Susan Morton Quincy gives a description of
the house of Ebenezer Storer in Boston, and in it
she says: “The ceilings were traversed through the
length of the rooms, by a large beam cased and finished
like the walls; and from the centre of each depended
a glass globe, which reflected as a convex
mirror, all the objects in the room.” These globes
also reflected the light from candles in the room.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>From the rafters or ceiling in plainer homes hung
sometimes a candle beam, a rude chandelier, made of
two pieces of metal crossed or a circle of metal, with
sockets for candles fixed upon them.</p>

<p>The chandelier in Illustration <a href="#i327">327</a> is for candles,
and is without doubt the finest one of its period in
this country. It is in the Pringle house in Charleston,
South Carolina, and it was probably placed in
the house when it was built in 1760, at which time
it was furnished with great elegance. It is amazing
that so frail a thing as this glass chandelier with
all of its shades should have survived the Civil
War, and still more, the earthquake which laid low
a large part of the city, but not one shade has been
shaken down. There are twenty-four branches to
the chandelier, twelve in each row, and a large glass
shade for each candle, to protect the flame from the
draughts. The long chains hang from a bell of glass,
from which fall glass drops, and from a large bowl
spring the branches with their tall shades, and
between them are glass chains with drops. The glass
chains are very light and the chandelier is not
loaded with heavy drops. It is impossible to imagine
anything more light and graceful in effect.</p>

<p>“Skreans” are mentioned in very early inventories,
and indeed they must have been a necessity, to
protect the face from
the intense heat of
the large open fire.
They afforded then,
as now, an opportunity
for the display of
feminine handiwork.
The dainty little fire-screen
in Illustration
<a href="#i328">328</a> was made about
1780, and is owned
by Mrs. Johnson-Hudson
of Stratford,
Connecticut. The
frame and stand are
of mahogany, and the
spreading legs are unusually
slender and
graceful. The embroidered
screen was
wrought by the
daughters of Dr.
William Samuel
Johnson, the first
president of Columbia
University. The
same young girls embroidered
the top of
the card-table in Illustration
<a href="#i199">199</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the work is done with the same patient industry
and skill. The vase which is copied in the
embroidery is of Delft, and is still owned in the
family.</p>

<p>A very curious and interesting piece of work is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i329">329</a>. It forms the back of a
sconce owned by Francis H. Bigelow, Esq., and in his
book “Historic Silver of the Colonies,” Mr. Bigelow
describes the candle bracket, made in 1720 by
Knight Leverett, which fits into the socket upon the
frame. Benjamin Burt, the silversmith, in his will
left to a niece “a sconce of quill work wrought by her
aunt.” In 1755 a Mrs. Hiller advertised to teach
“Wax work, Transparent and Filligree, Quill work
and Feather work.” “Quill work” is made of paper
of various colors, gilt upon one side, rolled tightly, like
paper tapers. Some were pulled out into points,
others made into leaf and petal-shaped pieces, and
when finished they were coated with some waxy substance,
and sprinkled with tiny bits of glass, all in gay
colors, and when the candles were lighted the quill
work glistened and sparkled.</p>

<p>The quill work in this sconce is made into an elaborate
design of a vase with flowers, and it is set
into a very deep frame, and covered tightly with
glass, which accounts for its perfect preservation.
The top ornament to the frame is cut in the manner
of looking glass frames of the period.</p>

a flattened claw-and-ball. The original embroidery
is still in the frame.</p>

<p>Another tripod screen is shown in Illustration

Esq., of Philadelphia. The embroidery and the frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
upon it were made in the nineteenth century but the
stand is much earlier and is finely carved in the
Chippendale style, with the French foot. Three
serpents encircle the pole, from which they are
completely detached. The wood is mahogany.</p>

Candle-stand, 1760-1770.</p>
</div>

<p>Both the screen and the candle-stand
in the illustration are made
of mahogany. The candlestick
upon the stand is a curious one,
of brass, with a socket for the
candle set upon an adjustable
arm, which also slides upon
a slender rod, which is fastened
into the heavily weighted standard.
Both screen and candle-stand
were made in the latter
half of the eighteenth century.
Candle-stands were designed by
all the great cabinet-makers,
and in those days of candlelight
they were a useful piece
of furniture.</p>

<p>A candle-stand in the finest
Chippendale style is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i333">333</a>. It is one of
a pair owned by Harry Harkness
Flagler, Esq. The intention
was presumably that a
candle-stand with candelabrum
should be placed at each side
of the mantel. A pair of
candle-stands similar to this are
in the banquet hall at Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Vernon, and are among the few pieces of furniture
there which are authenticated as having been in
use during Washington’s occupancy of the house.
The candle-stand in the illustration is forty-two
inches high, and its proportions are beautiful. The
legs and the ball at the base of the fluted pillar
are very finely carved. The legs end in the French
foot, the scroll turning forward, which was such a
favorite with Chippendale. The top is carved out
so that there is a raised rim, like that upon the
“dish-top” table in Illustration <a href="#i246">246</a>.</p>

<p>The first recorded instance in this country of
lighting by artificial gas is in 1806, when David
Melville of Newport, Rhode Island, succeeded in
manufacturing gas, and illuminated his house and
grounds with it. In 1822 Boston was lighted by
gas, but it did not come into general use for lighting
until 1840-1850.</p>

<p>During the second quarter of the nineteenth century
it was fashionable to use candelabra and lamps
which were hung with cut-glass prisms. Sets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
candelabra for the mantel were very popular, consisting
of a three-branched candelabrum for the
middle and a single light for each side. The base
was usually of marble, and the gilt standard was
cast in different shapes,&mdash;of a shepherd and shepherdess,
a group of maidens, or a lady clad in the
costume of the day. From an ornament at the base
of the candle, shaped like an inverted crown, hung
sparkling prisms, catching the light as they quivered
with every step across the room. A handsome set of
these is shown in Illustration <a href="#i318">318</a> upon the mantel.</p>

the lantern is held by
scrolls of metal like the frame of the glass. Such
a lantern as this may have been in the mind of Peter
Faneuil of Boston when in 1738 he sent to Europe
for “a very handsome Lanthorne to hang in an
Entry way.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">UNTIL about 1600, clocks
were made chiefly for
public buildings or for the
very wealthy, who only
could afford to own them; but
with the seventeenth century began
the manufacture of clocks for
ordinary use; these clocks were
of brass, and were known as
chamber clocks. The earliest form
in which they were made was
what is now called the “birdcage”
or “lantern” clock. Inventories
in this country from
1638 to 1700 speak of clocks
with valuations varying from £2
to £20, and occasionally a “brass
clock” is specified. This must refer, as some of
the others may also have done, to the lantern clock.</p>

Century.</p>
</div>

<p>The lantern clock in Illustration <a href="#i339">339</a> is owned by
William Meggatt, Esq., of Wethersfield. The illustration
shows the form of the clock, from which it naturally
derived the names “lantern” and “birdcage.”
The clock is set upon a bracket, and the weights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
hang upon cords or chains passing
through openings in the shelf; the
pendulum also swings through a
slit in the shelf.</p>

<p>The dial projects
beyond the frame of the clock,
and is six inches in diameter, and
there is but one hand. The dome
at the top is partially concealed by
the frets above the body of the
clock. Different clock-makers had
frets of their own, and the design
of the fret is often a guide for determining
the date of such clocks.
The one upon the clock in Illustration
<a href="#i339">339</a> is what was called the
“heraldic fret” from the small
escutcheon in the centre, and it
was used upon clocks made from
1600 to 1640. The fret with
crossed dolphins was in use from
1650, and is the pattern of fret
most frequently found upon these
clocks. The long pendulum must
have been a later substitution, for
it was not commonly used until
1680, clocks up to the time of its
invention having the short or
“bob” pendulum. There is no
maker’s name upon this clock.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i340">340</a> shows a “lantern”
clock in the house of Charles R. Waters, Esq.,
which has a fret of a later period, and the long pendulum.
The dial is slightly larger than the one
in Illustration <a href="#i339">339</a>, and upon it is engraved the
name of the maker, Jno. Snatt, Ashford. This
name is not in Britten’s list of clock-makers, so it is
probable that Jno. Snatt was a country clock-maker.
The clock was made about 1680. The brackets are
modern.</p>

<p>A clock which was made during the seventeenth
century is shown in Illustration <a href="#i340">341</a>. It is known
as a Friesland clock, from the fact that clocks of this
style are common in the north of Holland, having
been in use there over two centuries. The pendulum
of this clock swings above the shelf. The
frame rests upon four wooden feet, and its sides
and back are of glass. The face and ornaments are
made of lead, the ornaments being gilded, except
the parrots at each side, which are painted in vivid
parrot greens. The mermaids upon the bracket are
painted in colors, and the face also is painted, the
whole making a gay bit of decoration. The Friesland
clocks generally have mermaids and parrots as
part of the decoration of clock and bracket. There
is a small brass dial in the centre of the face, which
can be set for the alarm. Friesland clocks were in
use in the seventeenth century in this country, probably
having been brought here by Dutch settlers.
This clock is owned by the writer.</p>

<p>Bracket clocks were made during the last years of
the seventeenth century with wooden cases, and they
were very popular during the eighteenth century.
They generally have a brass handle at the top by
which they can be carried. A bracket clock with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
brass face and sides may be seen upon the mantel in
Illustration <a href="#i388">388</a>. It has the plate of the maker over
the dial, with the name Daniel Ray, Sudbury, probably
an English clock-maker. This clock was made
about 1760.</p>

     <p class="cf">Illus. 342.&mdash;Bracket Clocks, 1780-1800.</p>
</div>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i342">342</a> shows two bracket clocks in the
collection of the late Major Ben: Perley Poore. The
larger one has the top
made in the arch form
instead of the bell top
like the clock in Illustration
<a href="#i388">388</a>, and this
would place its date
about 1780. The name upon this clock, George
Beatty, Georgetown, was that of the owner. The
smaller clock has an inlaid case, and was evidently
made after Sheraton’s designs of 1790-1800. Both
clock-cases are of mahogany.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of tall clocks in inventories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
is in the latter part of the seventeenth century, where
they are always spoken of as “clock and case.” The
use of the long pendulum was probably the cause
of the development of the tall clock from the “lantern
clock,” which had often a wooden hood over
it; and when the long pendulum came into use in
1680, the lower part of the tall clock-case was made
to enclose the pendulum, and sides and a glass front
were added to the hood. The first cases were of
oak or walnut, and the dials were square, but early
in the eighteenth century the arched top was added
to the dial, suggested perhaps by the shape of the
dome.</p>

<p>The ornaments which fill in the spandrels, or
corners of the face, are somewhat of a guide to the
date of a brass-faced clock. The earliest spandrels
had cherubs’ heads with wings, and this design was
used from 1671 until 1700, when more ornaments
were added to the cherub’s head. Later came a still
more elaborate design of two cherubs supporting a
crown, until about 1750, when the scrolls were made
without the cherubs, but with a shield or head in the
centre of the spandrel.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i343">343</a> shows two tall clocks which were
owned originally by Thomas Hancock, from whom
John Hancock inherited them. Thomas Hancock
was a wealthy resident of Boston in 1738 when he
wrote thus to London, ordering a clock of “the
newest fashion with a good black Walnut Tree Case
Veneered work, with Dark, lively branches; on the
Top instead of Balls let there be three handsome
Carv’d figures. Gilt with burnish’d Gold. I’d have
the Case without the figures to be 10 feet Long, the
price 15 not to exceed 20 Guineas, &amp; as it’s for my own
use, I beg your particular Care in buying of it at the
Cheapest Rate. I’m advised to apply to one Mr.
Marmaduke Storr at the foot of Lond<sup>n</sup> Bridge.”</p>

<p>Which of these two clocks was sent to fill this order
we cannot tell. The clock with “Walnut Tree
Case Veneered work, with Dark, lively branches”
has the name plate of “Bowly, London,” probably
Devereux Bowley, who lived from 1696 to 1773 and
who was master of the Clock-Makers’ Company in
1759. The gilt ornaments are missing from the top,
so we do not know whether they were the ones so
carefully specified in the letter. Both clocks may
date to 1738. The clock with the lacquered case
has the name “Marm<sup>d</sup> Storr, foot of London Bridge,”
the same to whom Thomas Hancock had “been advised
to apply.” This clock has the “Balls” at the
top to which he objected. Possibly the zealous friend
may have sent both clocks. The one with a walnut
case is now owned by the American Antiquarian
Society, to which it was presented, with other pieces
bought from the Hancock house in 1838, by John
Chandler of Petersham. The clock with lacquered
case was also bought from the Hancock house, and
is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, to
which it is loaned by Miss Lucy Gray Swett.</p>

<p>A clock-maker well known in and around Boston
in the last half of the eighteenth century was Gawen
Brown, who had a shop on State Street, and who
made the clock upon the Old South Church, in Boston.
A letter is still preserved which he wrote asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
permission to make a clock for the
Society, and he “Promises and
Engages that the same shall be
put Up and continued
there forever.”</p>

<p>A Gawen Brown
clock is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i344">344</a>,
made for his father-in-law,
the Rev.
Mather Byles.
The case is pine
painted and the
shape of the top
and the general
appearance would
indicate that it
was an early effort
made before 1768.
It is still running
in the rooms of the Bostonian Society,
in the Old State House in
Boston.</p>

<p>The clock in Illustration <a href="#i345">345</a> was made by Gawen
Brown, and is in a very handsome mahogany case.
It is also owned by the Bostonian Society.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i346">346</a> shows a clock owned by the
writer, and is given as an example of the use of
curly maple, of which the entire case is made. It is
unusually tall, over eight feet in height.</p>

<p>The clock in Illustration <a href="#i346">347</a> was made by David
Rittenhouse, in Philadelphia, and is owned by
Charles D. Clark, Esq., of Philadelphia. David
Rittenhouse was a maker of clocks and mathematical
instruments, and an astronomer. He held various
positions of importance, and was State Treasurer of
Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary war, and
President of The American Philosophical Society.
This clock has a very handsome case of mahogany
with fine inlaying, and possesses seven dials. The
large dial has three hands, two for the hours and
minutes, and the third to point the day of the month.
This is set on the first day of each month. At the two
upper corners are two small dials, one of which is
set to designate which of the twelve tunes shall be
played, and the other has on it “strike” and “silent,”
also for the tunes. Above, the moon shows its phases
and the sun rises and sets every day. Upon the
round dial below, the planets revolve around the
sun.</p>

<p>The columns

This clock is owned by Francis
H. Bigelow, Esq., of Cambridge.</p>

<p>After the War of the Revolution
enamelled or painted dials
took the place of brass dials in
this country, to a great extent,
the chief reason being, of course,
their smaller cost. The works
were made by clock-makers who
sold them to pedlers, and they
took them, four or five at a time,
into the country towns to sell;
the local cabinet-maker made the
case, while the local clock-maker
put his own name upon the
dial. During the latter years of
the eighteenth century, there was
a fashion for using moving figures
above the dial, a ship heaving
upon the waves being the
favorite. Many clocks have a
painted moon, which rises and
sets each month. Miniature tall
clocks were made at this time,
corresponding in proportions to
the tall clocks.</p>

a ball with three sprays
of flowers. The clock was

<p>The most famous
name among American
clock-makers is
Willard. There
were three Willard
brothers,&mdash;Benjamin,
Simon, and
Aaron,&mdash;clock-makers
in Grafton,
Massachusetts, in
1765. Benjamin and
Simon established a
business in Roxbury,
and in December,
1771, Benjamin
advertised in
the <i>Boston Evening
Post</i> his “removal
from Lexington to
Roxbury. He will
sell house clocks neatly made, cheaper than imported.”
February 22, 1773, he advertised that he
“at his shop in Roxbury Street, pursues the different
branches of clock and watch work, and has for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
sale musical clocks, playing different tunes, a new
tune each day, and on Sunday a Psalm tune. These
tunes perform every hour.... All the branches
of the business likewise carried on in Grafton.” The
third brother, Aaron, may have remained in Grafton,
for he went from there later to Roxbury, as
fifer of a company of minute-men, in the first days
of the War of the Revolution. Simon Willard remained
in the same shop in
Roxbury for over seventy
years, dying in 1848 at the
great age of ninety-six years.
Aaron Willard built a shop
in Boston and made a specialty
of tall striking clocks.</p>

</div>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i352">352</a> shows a
clock owned by Dr. G. Faulkner
of Jamaica Plain. Inside
the clock is written in a quaint
hand, “The first short time-piece
made in America, 1784.”
Dr. Faulkner’s father was
married at about that date,
and the clock was made for
him. It has always stood
upon a bracket upon the wall,
and has been running constantly
for one hundred and
seventeen years. Upon the
scroll under the dial is the inscription “Aaron Willard,
Roxbury.” The case is of mahogany, and
stands twenty-six inches high. Upon the lower part
are very beautiful scroll feet, turning back. The
upper part stands upon ogee feet, and can be lifted
off. The glass door is painted so that it forms a
frame for the dial.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard, the founder of the
Howard Watch Company, has told me that the
Willards invented this style of clock as well as
the style known as the banjo clock. Mr. Howard
was born in 1813 and when he was sixteen he started
to learn his trade in Boston, in the shop of Aaron
Willard, Jr. I have not been able to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
clocks of this style were made in England at all,
and they seem to be purely American, but in Britten’s
“Old Clocks and Watches and their Makers”
is an illustration of an astronomical clock made by
Henry Jenkins, 1760 to 1780, with a case very similar
in shape to these clocks, and with a top like the
centre one of the three in Illustration <a href="#i353">353</a>. Aaron
Willard may have obtained his idea from such a
clock. The clock in Illustration <a href="#i352">352</a> is the earliest
one that I have heard of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i353">353</a> shows three clocks made some
years later, probably about 1800 to 1815. The clock
with the ogee feet is a Willard clock, and belongs
to W. S. G. Kennedy, Esq. The clock with the
door of bird’s-eye maple and the inlaid fan-shaped
top is owned by Mrs. E. A. Morse. The third
clock is owned by the writer.</p>

<p>Another New England clock-maker of long and
picturesque life was Stephen Hassam, sometimes
called Hasham. He was born in 1761, and is said to
have lived to be over one hundred years old. He was
a witness, when a boy, of the battle of Bunker Hill
from the steeple of a church in Boston, and he lived
until after the beginning of the Civil War. He
moved from Boston to Grafton and then to Worcester,
where he learned the clock-maker’s trade, perhaps
with the Willards who lived in those towns at
about that time. He established himself finally in
Charlestown, New Hampshire, where he lived and
made clocks, which are highly valued for their excellent
qualities, as well as for the associations
with the name of the centenarian clock-maker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>A clock similar in size, and also in design, to the
last four illustrated is shown in Illustration <a href="#i354">354</a>.
It was made by Stephen
Hassam and bears his name.
It is owned by Charles H.
Morse, Esq., and has always
stood since it was made,
about 1800, upon a mahogany
bracket in the corner.
The case is of very finely
grained mahogany.</p>

<p>Simon Willard patented
in 1802 an improved time-piece,
which Mr. Howard
says is the clock now known
as the “banjo” clock. Illustration
<a href="#i355">355</a> shows a clock
bought by the writer in a
country town from an old
man who called it a time-piece,
which is the name
given it in the country,
“banjo” being suggested to
the modern mind by the
shape of the upper part.
The sides of the clock are
of mahogany. The glass
door to the face is convex
and is framed in brass, and
the ornaments at the sides
of the clock are also of brass.</p>

<p>Aaron Willard, Jr., entered his
father’s employ in his shop in Boston
in 1823, and continued the business
for forty years. When
one considers that
members of this family
manufactured clocks
for over one hundred
years, it does not seem

the name of Willard
upon them.</p>

<p>Eli Terry was the first of another
famous family of American clock-makers.
He started in business in
1793, in Plymouth, near Waterbury,
Connecticut, a town well known ever
since for its clocks and watches. His
first clock was made a year earlier, a
wooden clock in a long case with a
brass dial, silver washed. He manufactured
the works for tall clocks, selling
them to pedlers, who took them
into the country to dispose of. In 1810 Seth
Thomas with Silas Hoadly bought the Terry factory,
and continued the manufacture of clocks for
long cases. Eli Terry in 1814 invented a wooden
shelf-clock, called “The Pillar Scroll Top Case,
with pillars 21 inches long resting on a square base,
dial 11 inches square, table below dial 7 inches by
11.” This clock sold for fifteen dollars, and was
made in enormous quantities. Illustration <a href="#i361">361</a>
shows two clocks, one an Eli Terry “Pillar Scroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Top” clock, with carved pillars similar to the ones
upon pieces of furniture of that period. The other
clock was made by Terry at about the same time.
Inside each of these clocks is pasted a paper upon
which is printed the following: “Patent Clocks,
invented by Eli Terry, Plymouth, Connecticut.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>From the time when such mantel clocks were
manufactured in great numbers, the fact that they
were cheap and good time-keepers put the tall clock
out of the market, and its manufacture practically
died out soon after, so that but few tall clocks were
made later than 1815-1820.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i362">362</a> shows a French clock with onyx
pillars, and elaborate Empire brasses. The large
ornaments at the side of the dial are of wood gilt.
The middle of the dial is occupied by a beautifully
wrought design in brass, of an anvil and grindstone,
each with a little Cupid. Upon the quarter-hour
one Cupid sharpens his arrow at the grindstone,
running the grindstone with his foot upon a treadle,
and at every hour the other Cupid strikes the anvil
with his hammer the necessary number of strokes.
A brass figure of a youth with a bow stands below
the dial, in front of the mirror in the back of the
clock. The base is of black marble. I have seen
several clocks similar with the onyx pillars, but none
with such beautiful, hand-wrought brass in the face
and upon the case.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">A STRONG distinction
was made in America
during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries
between mirrors and looking-glasses;
the name “mirror”
was applied to a particular kind
of glass, either convex or concave,
and one old authority states that
“a mirror is a circular convex
glass in a gilt frame.”</p>

<p>Looking-glasses appear in inventories
in this country as
early as 1650, and in 1658 William
Bartlett of Hartford left
no less than ten, the dearest
valued at one pound.</p>

<p>In 1670 the Duke of Buckingham brought Venetian
workmen to England, and established glass
works in Lambeth; but up to that date the looking-glasses
occasionally mentioned in inventories must
have been made in Venice. Some of the records
are “a great looking glass,”&mdash;“looking glass with
brasses,”&mdash;“great looking glass of ebony,”&mdash;“an
olive wood diamond cut looking glass,”&mdash;and “a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
looking glass with a walnut tree frame.” The glass
usually had the edge finished with a slight bevelling
about an inch
wide, made by hand, of
course, which followed
the outline of the inside
of the frame.</p>

</div>

<p>Hungerford Pollen, in
“Furniture and Woodwork,”
says: “The
looking-glasses made in
the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries
... had the plates
finished by an edge
gently bevelled, of an
inch in width, following
the form of the frame,
whether square or
shaped in curves. It is
of great difficulty in
execution, the plate being
held by the workman
over his head, and
the edges cut by grinding....
The angle of
the” (modern) “bevel is
generally too acute,
whereby the prismatic
light produced by this
portion of the mirror is in too violent and showy
contrast to the remainder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>One can always distinguish an old bevel, by
rubbing the finger upon it. The bevel is so slight
that it can hardly be felt, where the modern bevel
is sharp and distinct.</p>

<p>Looking-glasses of large size were made in two
sections, the lower piece with the edge bevelled and
lapped over the plain
upper piece. This
was to avoid the tax
upon glass beyond a
certain size.</p>

<p>The fashion for
japanning or lacquering
which obtained
vogue at the close of
the seventeenth century
was followed in
looking-glass frames.
A London newspaper
of 1689 thus advertised:
“Several sorts
of Screwtores, Tables,
Stands and Looking-glasses
of Japan and
other work.”</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i363">363</a> shows a looking-glass in a japanned
frame, owned by Dwight M. Prouty, Esq., of Boston.
The wood of the frame is walnut, and it is covered
with lacquer in gold and colors. The shape of the
frame around the glass is followed by the bevel,
and the lower piece of glass laps over the upper.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i364">364</a> shows the top section of a looking-glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
with a lacquered frame. In this case the
frame was made in sections, the lower section being
lost. The curves in the frame are followed in the
glass by the old shallow bevelling over an inch in
width, and a star is cut in the middle of the glass.
The frame is elaborately japanned with gold and
bright colors, and is twenty-six inches in height,
showing that the looking-glass, when whole, was of
generous size. The design of the sawed edge is of a
very early style. The glass is owned by the American
Antiquarian Society, of Worcester.</p>

<p>The looking-glass at the head of this chapter is
owned by E. R. Lemon, Esq., of the Wayside Inn.
It is of walnut veneer, and the old bevelled glass
is in two sections, the upper one cut in a design,
and with the lower edge lapped over the other piece
of glass. Another glass of the same period, the
first quarter of the eighteenth century, owned by
Mr. Lemon, heads Chapter XI. This frame has a
top ornament of a piece of walnut sawed in curves
which suggest those upon later frames.</p>

<p>Such a looking-glass as this was probably what
Judge Sewall meant when he sent for “A True
Looking Glass of Black Walnut Frame of the Newest
Fashion (if the Fashion be good) as good as can
be bought for five or six pounds.” This was for
wedding furniture for the judge’s daughter Judith,
married in 1720.</p>

<p>A looking-glass of the same date, with a carved
wood frame, silvered, heads Chapter VI. It was
originally owned by an ancestor of the late Major
Ben: Perley Poore, and was probably made in
Europe. It has always, within the memory of the
family, been silvered, and it is safe to say that it was
so originally. The
carving is rather
crudely done, the
ornament at the
top containing a
bird which is sitting
upon a
cherub’s head.
This glass is now
at Indian Hill,
Newburyport.</p>

<p>In nothing is
the charm of association
more potent
than in an
old looking-glass,
when one considers
the faces
and scenes that
have been reflected
in it. Illustration
<a href="#i365">365</a>
shows a looking-glass
which hung
in the Schuyler
mansion at Stillwater,
New York,
in which Washington
stopped
over night; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
although the quicksilver is somewhat worn off the
back of the glass, the thought that it must have
mirrored the face of Washington preserves it from
being restored. The shape is extremely graceful,
and the outline of the inside of the frame is followed
by little scrolls cut in the glass. The frame is carved
in wood, and gilt, and was probably made in Italy
about 1730. It is now owned by the writer. The
low-boy in the illustration is described upon page <a href="#Page_39">39</a>.</p>

<p>Rococo and Chinese designs were rampantly
fashionable in frames for looking-glasses from 1750
to 1780. They present an astonishing combination
of Chinese pagodas, shells, flowers, branches, animals,
and birds, with occasionally a figure of a man or
woman considerably smaller than the flowers and
birds upon the same frame.</p>

<p>Some of the famous designers of frames were
Matthias Lock, who published “A Book New of
Pier Frames, Oval Girandoles, Tables, etc.,” in
1765; Edwards and Darley; and Thomas Johnson;
besides the better-known cabinet-makers Ince and
Mayhew and Chippendale. Lock and Johnson
devoted much space to frames for girandoles, pier
glasses, ovals, and chimney-pieces, all elaborately
carved with scrolls and shells with dripping water,
birds, and animals of every sort from a monkey to a
cow, the latter unromantic and heavy creature figuring
upon a dripping scroll in one of Johnson’s frames.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i366">366</a> shows a looking-glass of the size
which was called a “pier” glass, which must have
been made about 1760. It is carved in walnut, and
the natural wood has never been stained or gilt. It
presents many of the characteristic designs fashionable
at that time, of scrolls and dripping water,
while no less than seven pagoda roofs form a part
of the frame. The figure, probably a Chinese lady
with a parasol, is missing from the pagoda at the
top. Below the frame is carved a little monkey
sitting in the lower scroll. The frame is rather
unusual in having side branches for candles. This
looking-glass and the one in the following illustration
are owned by Mrs. Charles Barrell of Barrell’s
Grove, York Corner, Maine, and are in the
old Barrell house, which stands with its original
furniture, as it stood one hundred and fifty years
ago. These looking-glasses were bought by a Barrell
ancestor at an auction in London, about 1795.
The articles sold at this auction were the furnishings
of one of the households of the Prince of
Wales, which was, temporarily at least, given up
by him upon his marriage, and these glasses have
reflected many a gay scene in which the “First
gentleman in Europe” figured, while Beau Brummel
may have used them to arrange the wonderful
toilettes which won him his name. What a change
to the little Maine village!</p>

<p>Another looking-glass of carved wood, with the
same history, is shown in Illustration <a href="#i367">367</a>. This
frame is gilded, and possesses none of the Chinese
designs of the other frame, but is purely rococo. It
has the old glass with bevelled edges. Both of
these looking-glasses must have been made at least
twenty-five years before the time when they were
sold at auction by the royal bridegroom.</p>

<p>At the head of Chapter V is shown a looking-glass
with a frame of white with gilt ornaments.
It formerly belonged to Governor Wentworth, and
is now in the Poore collection at Indian Hill. It is
similar in design and decoration to the looking-glasses
seen in French palaces, and was probably
made in France about 1760.</p>

<p>A charming oval looking-glass which might be
of the present latest fashion forms the heading to
Chapter III. It has the flowing ribbon bow-knot
which Chippendale
employed, and which
has been fashionable
ever since. This
looking-glass was
made about 1770,
and was inherited by
Miss H. P. F. Burnside
of Worcester
from her great-grandmother.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i368">368</a>
shows a fine looking-glass
with a frame of
carved wood. There
is a small oval medallion
below the frame
with emblems of
Freemasonry in gilt
upon a black ground.
A large medallion is
above the glass, with
Cupids painted upon
a black ground, and
the frame is surmounted
by an eagle.
This looking-glass is
owned by Mrs. Charles
R. Waters of Salem.</p>

<p>Another of the
same period, with
a carved wood
frame, is shown at
the beginning of
Chapter IV. This
frame has a classical
design of garlands
of laurel with an
urn at the top.
The small oval
medallion at the
base of both of
these frames seems
to be a feature of
such looking-glasses,
together
with the garlands
of carved wood.
This looking-glass
is owned by the
writer. Upon its
back is an oak
board which must
have been prized
highly, for it has
been carefully repaired
with two
patches of wood set
into it.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i369">369</a>
shows a looking-glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
made in the first half of the eighteenth century,
of walnut. The gilt mouldings are carved in wood,
as are the gilt leaves and flowers at the side. The
waving line of the inside of the frame is followed in
the bevelling of the glass. Glasses of this period
were usually made in two pieces, to lessen the expense,
the edge of one piece of glass being simply
lapped over the other. This looking-glass is unusually
large, seven and one-half feet high and three
feet wide. It is now owned by the Philadelphia
Library Association, and was used in 1778 at the
famous Mischianza fête, where probably the lovely
Peggy Shippen and the beautiful Jewess, Rebecca
Frank, and perhaps the ill-fated André, used the
glass to put the finishing touches to their toilettes,
or to repair the damages wrought during the gay
dances of that historic ball.</p>

<p>A looking-glass showing the development from
the one in Illustration <a href="#i369">369</a> may be seen in Illustration
<a href="#i26">26</a> upon page <a href="#Page_39">39</a>. The frame is more elaborate
than the older one in its curves and in the pediment
with the broken arch, and its date is about
1770. The original glass is gone, so we cannot tell
if it was bevelled, but it probably was. This very
fine frame came from the Chase mansion in Annapolis,
and is now owned by Harry Harkness Flagler,
Esq., of Millbrook, New York.</p>

<p>Another looking-glass owned by Mr. Flagler is
shown in Illustration <a href="#i370">370</a>. The frame is of walnut
veneer, and the shape of the glass without any curves
at the top, and the garlands at the side more finely
modelled and strung upon a wire, determine it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>

Illustration <a href="#i369">369</a>.</p>

<p>A looking-glass with a mahogany and gilt frame,
owned by the
writer, is shown in
the heading to
Chapter IX. This
looking-glass dates
between the last
two described; the
curved form of the
upper edge of the
glass in Illustration
<a href="#i26">26</a> leaving a slight
reminder in the cut-off,
upper corners
of this glass, which
vanishes in the
square corners of
the one in Illustration
<a href="#i370">370</a>. The garlands
at each side
are carved from
wood, without wire.
These looking-glasses
are now reproduced
in large
numbers and are
sometimes called
Washington glasses, from the fact that one hangs
upon the wall in a room at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>A very unusual looking-glass is shown in Illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>

<p>Glasses of this

<p>The looking-glass
which heads Chapter
XIII is in the
Metropolitan Museum
of Art and
is of the same period as the glass in Illustration <a href="#i371">371</a>.</p>

<p>A looking-glass is shown in the heading to Chapter
VIII in which the decoration is produced by
both carving and sawing, as well as by gilt ornaments.
The sawing of ornamental outlines appears
upon the earliest frames, such as Illustration <a href="#i364">364</a>,
and is found upon frames made during the eighteenth
century until its close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last quarter of the eighteenth century
frames which are apparently a cheaper form of
the mahogany and gilt looking-glasses described,
were most popular, and are commonly found.
These frames are veneered with mahogany or walnut,
and are sawed in outlines similar to those
of the richer frames of walnut or mahogany and
gilt. The inside of the frame next the glass has
a narrow hand-carved gilt moulding, and there is
sometimes a gilt bird flying through the opening
sawed in the upper part of the frame, while in
other frames the opening is partially filled by three
feathers, a conventional shell, or a flower in gilt.
Occasionally a line of inlaying follows the gilt
moulding next the glass. In smaller looking-glasses
a gilded plaster eagle was glued upon the frame
above the glass. Such frames may be found, or
rather might have been found, in almost any old
house.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i376">376</a> shows two of these looking-glasses.
The larger glass is owned by the writer,
the smaller by W. S. G. Kennedy, Esq., of
Worcester.</p>

<p>A looking-glass with some variations from those
previously shown forms the heading to Chapter X.
The lower part of the frame has the sawed outlines
which appear upon so many, while the upper
part has a broken arch cornice of a high and slender
design, showing the influence of the lighter Hepplewhite
styles. A colored shell is inlaid in the top of
this frame, and there are two rows of fine inlaying
around the glass. The frame is surmounted by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
urn or vase with flowers and stalks of wheat, upon
wires, like the slender garlands at the sides. This

Albany.</p>

<p>These
knobs were sometimes
made of brass, but the
most fashionable mirror
knobs were those with
a medallion, round or
oval, of Battersea enamel
upon copper,
framed in brass. The
design of the medallions
varied, heads of historical
personages being
very popular, while flowers,
landscapes, fancy
heads, the eagle and
thirteen stars, and the
ever-favorite design of
the monument and
weeping willow appear
in the bright tints of
the enamel. Dwight
Blaney, Esq., of Boston,
has a collection of over
one hundred knobs.
Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Lord Nelson are
some of the heads found upon mirror knobs. Four
pairs of enamelled knobs, owned by the writer, appear
in Illustration <a href="#i379">379</a>. The head of Lord Nelson
figures upon one pair.</p>

</div>

<p>“A circular convex glass in a gilt frame” is shown
in Illustration <a href="#i380">380</a>. Such glasses were advertised as
“mirrors,” in distinction from the looking-glasses
which were in ordinary use, and they were sold in
pairs, for sconces,
the convex or
occasionally concave
glass precluding
the possibility
of its use for
a literal looking-glass,
as any person
will agree who
has caught in one
a glimpse of a distorted
reflection
of face or figure.</p>

<p>These mirrors
were fashionable
during the last
quarter of the
eighteenth century,
and were
made in various
sizes, from twelve
inches in diameter
to three feet. The
eagle formed the
most popular ornament for the top, but many were
made with a winged horse, or a sort of dragon,
instead of the eagle. These mirrors were called
girandoles, like others with branches for candles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
The girandole in Illustration <a href="#i380">380</a> is owned by the

<p>Illustration <a href="#i386">386</a> shows a looking-glass in a frame
the main portion of which is of salmon-colored
marble, which is glued or cemented to the wood in
small thin pieces. Upon the edges of this marble
is a narrow gilt moulding, and the ornaments at the
top and bottom are of gilt, the fine scrolls at the top
being made of wire. Such looking-glasses have
been found in New England, chiefly in Massachusetts,
and the majority that have been traced have
Marblehead as their starting-point in this country.
In Marblehead they are known as “Bilboa glasses,”
and the story of the old wives of Marblehead is that
these glasses were all brought home by sailors who
had been to Bilboa, “In the bay of Biscay, oh,” and
that the looking-glasses were either given as presents
to wives or sweethearts, or more prosaically exchanged
for a cargo of Marblehead dried fish. The
frames, however, would appear to be of Italian
origin, if one wishes to be accurate, and discard the
picturesque Marblehead legend.</p>

<p>The looking-glass in Illustration <a href="#i386">386</a> is now in the
Boston Art Museum. The “Bilboa glasses” are
nearly all similar to this in design, with marble
pillars at the side and gilt ornaments at the top and
bottom. The glass is the original one with the
shallow, wide bevel, and the frame, exclusive of the
ornaments at the top and bottom, measures twenty-five
inches in height and eighteen in width.</p>

<p>Another “Bilboa glass” is shown in the heading
to Chapter VII. This glass is owned by Mrs.
M. G. Potter of Worcester, and the story in the
family is that this looking-glass was made by Captain
John Potter of North Brookfield, a well-known
clock-maker and metal-worker, as a present to his
bride, about 1790. The glass has always been fastened
to the black panel behind it, within the memory
of the family. The probability is that the black
panel was made by Captain Potter, the frame of
marble with its fine gilt ornamentation having been
brought originally with other Bilboa looking-glasses
to Marblehead, from Italy or Spain, whichever
place they may have been brought from.</p>

<p>The top

or other designers of his day. Several “Bilboa”
frames have been found with this little fence at
the top. Other Bilboa frames have an oval or round
painted panel in the centre of the light, open gilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
ornament at the top. Two Bilboa glasses are in the
collection of Francis H. Bigelow, Esq., with the marble
in the frame dark with white veins, instead of
the usual salmon color, but made in the same design
with the columns at the sides.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century, particularly the
latter years, it was fashionable to have a looking-glass
on the mantel, extending nearly the length
of the shelf, and divided into three sections, the
larger section in the middle. The line where the
glass was joined was covered by a narrow gilt
moulding. Such a looking-glass is shown in Illustration
<a href="#i387">387</a>. It has the overhanging cornice which
was a feature of these glasses, and which was used
as early as 1783. A panel of black basalt with a classical
design is set into the cornice above the glass,
and two small panels above the side columns.
Francis H. Bigelow, Esq., owns this looking-glass. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
probably was made about 1790, when Wedgwood and
Flaxman designs were popular. Another mantel
glass of simpler style is shown in Illustration

<p>Cheval glasses were

times, to judge from
the small number of old specimens found. Illustration
<a href="#i389">389</a> shows one with a frame and stand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
mahogany, owned by Mrs. N. F. Rogers of Worcester,

<p>Looking-glasses were made from 1810 to 1825,
following the
heavy designs
which were
fashionable at
that period,
and these
glasses are
commonly
found. By
this time the
shallow bevel
upon the glass
had disappeared,
and
the glass in
these heavy
gilt frames is
always plain.
The overhanging
cornice,
often
with acorns or
balls beneath,
is a feature of
these glasses,
one of which
is shown in
Illustration <a href="#i390">390</a>, with a classical design below the

<p class="drop-cap04">NOWHERE in this
country can the
interiors of the
old houses and their
woodwork be studied as in
Salem. The splendid mansions
around Philadelphia
and in Maryland and Virginia
are detached and not
always accessible, but in Salem
one may walk through
the old streets with a certainty
that almost any of the
houses passed will prove to
contain features of interest
to the student. The town
was the home of wealthy
ship-owners and East India
merchants, who built there
the houses which we study,
for their homes. They did
not spare expense&mdash;the Derby house cost $80,000;
and they were fortunate in having for a fellow
citizen a wood-carver, and designer, Samuel McIntire,
whose work will bear comparison with that of
men whose names have been better known. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the last few years, however, McIntire’s name and
work have attracted more attention, and his mantels
and doors in Salem have been shown to the reading
public in the book “The Woodcarver of Salem,” by
Frank Cousins and Phil M. Riley.</p>

<p>McIntire built the eighty thousand dollar Derby
house, which within a short time of its completion was
torn down, owing to the death of Mr. Derby, none of
the heirs wishing to keep so costly a mansion. Just
at that time, in 1804, Captain Cook was building
the house now known as the Cook-Oliver house.
McIntire, who was the architect also of this house,
persuaded Captain Cook to use much of the fine
woodwork which he had made for Mr. Derby, and
it was embodied in the Cook house, which was, when
finished, given to the daughter of Captain Cook,
who married General Oliver, the composer of the
hymn, “Federal Street,” named for the street upon
which this house stands.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i395">395</a> shows a doorway in the hall of the
Cook-Oliver house, which was taken from the Derby
mansion. The wood is pine, as in most of the Salem
houses, painted white, and the ornamentation is all
hand-carved. The design is thoroughly classical,
with its graceful drapery across the top, and the urns,
also ornamented with drapery. Through the doorway
may be seen the mantel, which was taken from
the Derby mansion, with the fine hob-grate, and a
little of the old Zuber paper, which extends around
the room, with scenes of the Paris of 1810-1820.</p>

Dalton Club. It was Michael Dalton who built this
house, but its golden years were during the ownership
of his son, Tristram Dalton, who married the daughter
of “King” Hooper, and who might well be called
by the same name as his father-in-law. In evidence
of his wealth and lavish manner of life is the story of
his splendid coach, lined with white satin, drawn by
six white horses, and attended by four outriders, all
in white and mounted upon white steeds. In this
dazzling equipage the various brides of the family left
the house, and the same royal splendor probably attended
the arrival at the house of famous guests, of
whom there were many. All this display does not
agree with the common notion of sober New England,
but smacks rather of the aristocratic Virginians who
built mansions on the James River. The doorways
and mantels in the Dalton house tell of great wealth,
for those early years of 1720. They are made of pine,
painted white, and all of the woodwork is hand
carved. The doorway in Illustration <a href="#i396">396</a> is in the
same room with the mantel in Illustration <a href="#i397">397</a> and is
designed in the same classical style, with fluted columns
and Ionic capitals. The cornice is the same,
and the egg and dart moulding upon it extends with
the cornice entirely around the room. The immediate
frame of the door has the same carved moulding
as the lower part of the cornice, and the window
frames. The door itself is very fine with eight
panels. The knob is new. The original knob was
of iron.</p>

the doorway, and at one side is a glimpse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
cornice and frame of the window with its deep seat.
The fluted square pilasters of the doorway, in the
mantel are changed to round detached columns,
and there is a plain panel with simple mouldings
over the narrow shelf.</p>

<p>The woodwork is
probably the finest in Boston, and is attributed, with
the building, to Bulfinch. The doorway in Illustration
<a href="#i401">401</a> is from the back parlor of the house. The
door is mahogany, and the carved woodwork of the
frame is in a severely classical design. The anthemion
figures upon the pilasters and in the capital, and
the design of the frieze is beautiful in its severity.
The house was built in 1818.</p>

<p>In his “Complete Body of Architecture” Isaac
Ware says of the chimney-piece: “No common room,
plain or elegant, could be constituted without it. No
article in a well-finished room is so essential. The
eye is immediately cast upon it on entering, and the
place of sitting down is naturally near it. By this
means it becomes the most eminent thing in the
finishing of an apartment.”</p>

<p>The mantelpiece in Illustration <a href="#i402">402</a> is in the banquet
hall of the house built in 1768, upon generous
plans, by Col. Jeremiah Lee in Marblehead. The
depth of the chimney is in the rear, and the mantel is
almost flush with the panelled walls. It is painted
white like the other woodwork, and is richly ornamented
with hand carving, in rococo designs, with
garlands of fruit and flowers in high relief, after the
fashion of the time, and has a plain panel over the
narrow shelf, which rests upon carved brackets.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i403">403</a> shows the beautiful landing at
the head of the stairway in the Lee mansion, with
the large window and Corinthian pilasters, and
the wonderful old paper, all in tones of gray.

<a href="#i414">414</a>
shows a doorway
leading into the
hall in the “Octagon”
in Washington,
D. C.
The house derives
its name from its shape, built to conform to
a triangular lot. Col. John Tayloe built it in 1800,
and for twenty-five years the entertainments given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
in the Octagon were famous. It is now occupied
by the American Institute of Architects. The
entrance to the house is in a circular tower of three
stories in height, thus utilizing the shape of the
triangle. This gives a large, circular vestibule
from which a wide, arched doorway leads into the hall
with the stairs, which are very simple, with plain
small balusters, and a mahogany rail. The doorway
is very fine, with fluted columns and carved capitals
and on the inside of the arch a row of carving, making
a beautiful entrance to the house.</p>

<p>The mantel in Illustration <a href="#i416">416</a> is in the Schuyler
mansion in Albany, New York, which has been wisely
and thoroughly restored to its original beauty, and
stands a monument not only of the Albany life of the
eighteenth century, but to the early efficiency of
woman, for it was built in 1760 by the wife of Gen.
Philip Schuyler, during the absence of her husband
in England. This mantel is in the room called the
Hamilton room, because it was here that the daughter
of the house, Elizabeth Schuyler, was married to
Alexander Hamilton. The wood of the mantel is,
like that in the other rooms, pine, painted white, and
the room is handsomely panelled, with a heavy cornice.
The shelf is narrow with a panel above it
which is surmounted by a cornice, with a broken
pediment. The mantel is very dignified and does
credit to the excellent taste of the colonial dame who
chose it and superintended its instalment.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i417">417</a> shows a mantel in Philipse Manor
in Yonkers, New York. The original house was
built in the seventeenth century, but in 1745 it was
greatly enlarged by Judge Philipse, the second lord
of the Manor, and it was probably at about that time
that the fine woodwork in the house was installed.
Judge Philipse was the father of Mary Philipse, to
whom in 1757 Washington paid court&mdash;unsuccessfully.
She married Roger Morris in 1758, and in 1779
fled with him to England, attainted as Royalists, together
with her brother, the third and last lord of the
Manor, which then passed from the Philipse family.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i421">421</a> shows the stairway at “Graeme
Park,” the house built in 1722 by Sir William Keith,
Governor of Penn’s Colony, at Horsham, Pennsylvania.
The place is named from Dr. Graeme, who
married the step-daughter of Gov. Keith, and occupied
the house after 1727. Gov. Keith lived here
in great style, with a large household, as his inventory
implies, with “60 bedsteads, 144 chairs, 32 tables and
15 looking-glasses.” The discrepancy between the
number of bedsteads and looking-glasses is accounted
for by the price of glass, and the probability that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
many of the sixty occupants of the bedsteads were
servants or slaves, whose toilet was not important,
and who did not live in the mansion, but in the outbuildings
around it. The house was built in accordance
with the manner of life of the Governor, and
contained large rooms, handsomely panelled and finished
in oak, unpainted. The stairs in Illustration
<a href="#i421">421</a> are all of oak, stairs, balusters, and rail, and are of
an entirely different style from the twisted balusters
and newels of the northern seaport towns, but
of a solidity and simplicity that is attractive.</p>

<p>Illustration <a href="#i422">422</a> shows the side wall of a chamber
at Graeme Park, also of oak. The fireplace is surrounded
by tiles, and the chimney-piece is panelled
above, but there is no shelf. The doorways at each
side of the mantel are charming, with the arch above
and the semicircular window. The old hinges and
latches are still upon the doors.</p>

<p>The doorway in Illustration <a href="#i423">423</a> is from the Chase
house in Annapolis, Maryland, and is in a room with
several doors and windows, all with their deeply
carved frames, painted white, with solid mahogany
doors, and hinges and latches of silver. The heavy
wooden inside shutters have large rosettes carved
upon them, and the effect of all this carving is extremely
rich. The Chase house was built in 1769,
by Samuel Chase, afterwards a Signer of the Declaration
of Independence, and Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court.</p>

and others, who
came to Philadelphia
while it

<a href="#i425">425</a>. It is plain, but attractive for its simplicity.</p>

<p>The balustrade
in Illustration
<a href="#i426">426</a> is in
the house of the
Misses Garrett
in Williamsburg,
Virginia, and is
in a Chinese fretwork
design.
There is one with
the same fretwork
in the Paca
house in Annapolis,
and probably
of the same
date, about 1765.
The winding
staircase in Illustration
<a href="#i427">427</a> is
in the house now
occupied by the
Valentine Museum,
in Richmond,
Virginia.
It was built
about 1812, and
was given to the
city for a museum, by the Valentine family. It is
a very good example of the stairway known as a
“winder.” Illustration <a href="#i428">428</a> shows a beautiful mantel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
